00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,590
一些很糟糕的话

53
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,290
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,290
她说她很高兴我已知道 她不想再偷偷摸摸了

55
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,390
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

56
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,390
她说她想离婚

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,290
- What was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,290
- 你当时有什么反应? - 我对她说我不会在乎的

59
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,590
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

60
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,590
"在我看见你在雷诺市前,下地狱吧!"

61
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,190
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

62
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,190
你的邻居曾听你说过这些话吧?

63
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,890
If they say so.

64
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,890
随他们怎么说

65
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,890
I really don't remember. I was upset.

66
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,890
我当时很不开心 什么都不记得了

67
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,590
What happened after you argued with your wife?

68
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,590
你和太太争吵后发生了什么事?

69
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,590
She packed a bag.

70
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,590
她收拾好行李

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,890
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

72
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,890
到昆汀先生家里去了

whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

76
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,990
你知道他是你妻子的情人

77
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,490
Did you follow her?

78
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,490
你跟踪她了吗?

79
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,890
I went to a few bars first.

80
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,890
我先去了几间酒吧找

81
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,490
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

82
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,490
接着 我开车去了昆汀家 但他们不在家里

83
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,590
I parked in the turnout

84
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,590
我把车停在街角

85
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,290
and waited.

86
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,290
等在那里

87
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,090
With what intention?

88
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,090
有何企图吗?

89
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,190
I'm not sure.

90
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,190
我不太确定

91
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,790
I was confused

92
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,790
我非常困惑

93
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,990
drunk.

94
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,990
还有点醉

95
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,890
I think

96
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,890
我觉得

97
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,190
mostly I wanted to scare them.

98
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,190
我只是想吓一吓他们

99
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,790
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

100
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,790
他们到家后 你就进屋杀了他们

101
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,090
I was sobering up.

102
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,090
没有 我控制了自己

103
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,990
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

104
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,990
我开车回家睡觉来忘记一切

105
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,090
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

106
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,090
在回家的路上 我把枪扔进了河里

107
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,290
I've been very clear on this point.

108
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,290
我很肯定这一点

109
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,590
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning

110
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,590
但我感到奇怪的是 第二天早上清洁女工发现

111
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,390
and finds your wife in bed with her lover

112
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,390
你太太和她的情人死在床上

113
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,690
riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

114
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,690
致死的子弹是出自点38口径的手枪

115
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,090
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

116
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,090
德福瑞恩先生 你和我一样都觉得那是巧合吗?

117
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
Yes, it does.

118
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,190
确实是巧合

119
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,590
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river

120
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,590
你仍坚持说你在凶案发生前

121
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,890
before the murders took place.

122
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,890
已经把枪扔进河里了吗?

123
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,290
That's very convenient.

124
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,290
这对你很有利

125
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,190
It's the truth.

126
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,190
这是事实

127
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,090
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found

128
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,090
警察在河里找了三天 但他们没有找到你的枪

129
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,290
so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets

130
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,290
所以无法鉴定

131
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,090
taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

132
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,090
死者身上的子弹是否出自你的枪

133
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,090
And that also

134
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,090
这对你来说

135
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,990
is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

136
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,990
也非常有利 不是吗 德福瑞恩先生?

137
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,390
Since I am innocent of this crime

138
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,390
因为我是无辜的

139
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,290
I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

140
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,290
所以我发现找不到枪对我非常不利

141
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,400
∮ If I Didn't Care

142
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,400
∮ 如果我不在乎

143
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,620
∮ And would I be sure that this

144
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,620
∮ 我会确信

145
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,290
∮ Is love beyond compare...

146
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,290
∮ 这是无与伦比的爱...

147
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,490
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

148
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,490
各位先生女士 你们听到了所有的证据

149
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,590
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

150
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,590
我们有他犯罪的动机 我们找到他的脚印

151
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,590
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

152
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,590
留有他的指纹的子弹头

153
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,790
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

154
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,790
打碎的酒瓶上也留有他的指纹

155
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,590
And most of all

156
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,590
最重要的是

157
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,790
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

158
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,790
我们知道他的妻子和她的情人

159
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,090
lying dead in each other's arms.

160
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,090
双双倒卧在血泊中

161
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,890
They had sinned.

162
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,890
他们是犯了错

163
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,590
But was their crime so great

164
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,590
但他们所犯的错严重到

165
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,090
as to merit a death sentence?

166
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,090
需要用死来赎罪吗?

167
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,590
While you think about that

168
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,590
当你们考虑时

169
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,790
think about this:

170
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,790
请想想这个

171
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,390
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

172
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,390
一个弹匣只能装六颗子弹 而不是八颗

173
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,290
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

174
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,290
我肯定这不只是一时冲动而犯下的罪行

175
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,290
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

176
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,290
那至少是可以理解的 即使不能宽恕

177
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,590
No.

178
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,590
不!

179
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,390
This was revenge

180
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,390
这是复仇

181
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,490
of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,490
一个冷血者的复仇 看看这些:

183
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,090
Four bullets per victim.

184
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,090
每个死者都身中四枪

185
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,590
Not six shots fired, but eight.

186
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,590
总共是八枪而不是六枪

187
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,690
That means that he fired the gun empty

188
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,690
那表明子弹打完后

189
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,890
and then stopped to reload

190
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,890
他还停下来装子弹

191
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,590
so that he could shoot each of them again.

192
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,590
以便再次向他们开枪

193
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,290
An extra bullet per lover

194
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,290
每人多加一枪

195
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,890
right in the head.

196
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,890
就在头部

197
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,190
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

198
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,190
德弗瑞恩先生 我觉得你非常冷血

199
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,690
It chills my blood just to look at you.

200
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,690
看着你都令我毛骨耸然

201
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,390
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine

202
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,390
我以本州赋予我的权利

203
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,890
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back

204
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,890
判处你两项终身监禁

205
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,790
one for each of your victims. So be it!

206
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,790
分别为两位死者 退庭!

207
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,090
Sit.

208
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,090
坐下来

209
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,490
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

210
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,490
你因被判终身监禁己在此二十年?

211
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,590
- Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?

212
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,590
- 是的 先生 - 你感到后悔吗?

213
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,590
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

214
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,590
是的 当然 先生

215
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,690
I mean, I learned my lesson.

216
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,690
我是说 我得到了教训

217
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,290
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

218
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,290
我敢说我已经完全改变了

219
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,890
I'm no longer a danger to society.

220
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,890
我不会再危害社会

221
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,990
That's God's honest truth.

222
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,990
这是神的真理

223
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,490
"不合格"

224
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,590
Hey, Red.

225
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,590
嗨 瑞德

226
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,090
How'd it go?

227
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,090
怎么样了?

228
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,490
Same old shit, different day.

229
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,490
不同的日子 同样的结果

230
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,590
Yeah, I know how you feel.

231
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,590
我知道你的感受的

232
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm up for rejection next week.

233
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,790
我下星期又要被否决了

234
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,090
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

235
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,090
对 我上星期也被否决了

236
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,690
It happens.

237
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,690
一向如此

238
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,290
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

239
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,290
嗨 瑞德 给我一包烟

240
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,790
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

241
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:29,790
滚开!你已欠我五包烟了

242
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,990
- Four! - Five

243
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,990
- 是四包! - 五包!

244
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,590
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

245
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,590
我想在美国的每个联邦或州监狱里都有像我一样的人物

246
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,590
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

247
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,590
就是能够给你搞到东西的家伙

248
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,890
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing

249
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,890
定制的香烟 一包大麻

250
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,490
bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

251
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,490
为庆祝你儿子或女儿高中毕业的一瓶白兰地  只要你喜欢

252
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,790
Damn near anything within reason.

253
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,790
或者几乎所有东西

254
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,790
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

255
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,790
是的 先生 我是个冷酷的人

256
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,690
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

257
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:56,690
所以1949年当安迪·德福瑞恩来找我

258
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,390
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him

259
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,390
问能否弄张丽塔·海华丝的图片进来时

260
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,890
I told him, "No problem."

261
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,890
我告诉他"没问题"

262
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,890
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

263
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,890
安迪·德弗瑞恩在1947年来到肖申克监狱

264
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,990
in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

265
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,990
罪名是谋杀他的妻子和她的情人

266
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,390
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

267
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,390
入狱以前 他是波特兰银行的副总裁

268
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,690
Good work for a man so young.

269
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,690
对他来说是年青有为

270
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,690
You speak English, butt-steak?

271
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,690
你会说英语吗?

272
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,790
You follow this officer.

273
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,790
跟着这个长官走

274
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,790
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

275
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,790
我一生中从没见过这么差劲的人

276
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,590
Hey, fish! Come over here!

277
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,590
过来啊! 到这里来

278
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,290
Taking bets today, Red?

279
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,290
今天要赌吗 瑞德?

280
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,290
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

281
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,290
赌烟还是赌钱?

282
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,190
Smokes. Put me down for two.

283
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,190
香烟 我赌两根

284
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,290
All right, who's your horse?

285
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,290
好吧 你买哪一个?

286
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,290
That little sack of shit.

287
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,290
那个又矮又瘦的

288
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,190
Eighth. He'll be first. Bullshit! I'll take that action.

289
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,190
排在第八的 他会是第一个的 妈的! 我也想买他

290
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,590
You're out some smokes, son.

291
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,590
你输定了 孩子

292
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,590
If you're so smart, you call it.

293
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,590
该你下注了

294
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,890
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

295
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,890
我买那边的那个胖子

296
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,690
The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.

297
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,690
排在第五的那个 我赌四根香烟

298
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,590
Fresh fish today!

299
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,590
今天又有新人

300
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,790
We're reeling them in!

301
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,790
我们又有的玩了

302
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,090
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

303
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,090
我承认我初次见到安迪的时候 没什么特别的感觉

304
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,590
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

305
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,590
他看起来似乎风一吹就会倒

306
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,990
That was my first impression of the man.

307
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,990
这就是我对他的第一印象

308
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,690
What do you say?

309
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,690
你买谁?

310
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,190
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

311
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,190
那个高个子

312
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,490
That guy? Never happen.

313
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,490
那个人?不可能的

314
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,990
10 cigarettes. That's a rich bet.

315
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,990
我赌十根香烟 那可是大赌注

316
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,290
Who's going to prove me wrong?

317
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,290
谁来证明我看错了?

318
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,290
Heywood? Jigger?

319
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,290
海伍德?济格?

320
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,890
Skeets?

321
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,890
史基?

322
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,390
Floyd!

323
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,390
弗洛德?

324
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,390
Four brave souls.

325
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,390
四个胆小鬼

326
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,390
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

327
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,390
回囚房去 要查房了

328
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,890
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

329
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,890
所有犯人都回囚房去

330
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,390
Turn to the right!

331
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,390
向右转

332
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,890
Eyes front.

333
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,890
往前看

334
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,590
This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.

335
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,590
这是哈德利先生 他是这里的看守长

336
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,890
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

337
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,890
我是诺顿 这里的典狱长

338
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,290
You are convicted felons.

339
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,290
你们都被判有罪了

340
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,590
That's why they've sent you to me.

341
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,590
因此被送到这里来

342
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,590
Rule number one:

343
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,590
规则一

344
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,190
No blasphemy.

345
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,190
不得亵渎上帝

346
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,190
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

347
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,190
在我的监狱里不得有人亵渎上帝

348
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,590
The other rules

349
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,590
其他的条例

350
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,090
you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?

351
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,090
其他的条例 你们慢慢就会知道了 还有问题吗?

352
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,490
When do we eat?

353
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,490
何时吃饭?

354
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,190
You eat when we say you eat.

355
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,190
我们叫你吃的时候你就吃

356
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,690
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.

357
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,690
叫你去厕所你就去厕所

358
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,690
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

359
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,690
明白吗?笨蛋?

360
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,990
On your feet.

361
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,990
站好

362
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,990
I believe in two things:

363
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,990
我只相信两样东西

364
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,590
Discipline and the Bible.

365
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,590
纪律和圣经

366
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,190
Here, you'll receive both.

367
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,190
在这里 你们两样都有

368
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,090
Put your trust in the Lord.

369
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,090
把你们的思想交给上帝

370
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,990
Your ass belongs to me.

371
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,990
你们的身体交给我

372
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,690
Welcome to Shawshank.

373
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,690
欢迎来到肖申克监狱

374
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,190
Unhook them.

375
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,190
解开他们

376
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,990
Turn around.

377
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:26,990
转过身

378
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,290
That's enough.

379
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,290
够了

380
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,190
Move to the end of the cage.

381
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,190
到笼子边上去

382
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,790
Turn around. Delouse him.

383
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,790
转身 给他消毒

384
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
Turn around.

385
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
转身

386
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,690
Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.

387
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,690
出来 去领你们的衣服和圣经

388
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,190
Next man up!

389
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,190
下一个!

390
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,990
To the right.

391
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,990
往右走

392
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,190
Right. Right.

393
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,190
右边 右边

394
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,990
Left.

395
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,990
左边

396
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,290
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.

397
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,290
毫无疑问 第一晚是最难熬的

398
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,790
They march you in naked as the day you were born

399
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,790
赤裸裸的进囚笼 就像刚出生时那样

400
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,790
skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.

401
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,790
消毒药粉令皮肤像被火烧一样

402
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,890
And when they put you in that cell

403
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,890
他们把你丢进囚笼

404
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,390
and those bars slam home

405
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,390
关上铁门

406
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,090
that's when you know it's for real.

407
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,090
那时你才感到这是真实的

408
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,690
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

409
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,690
瞬间过去的一切都离你而去

410
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,190
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

411
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:27,190
剩下的只有对过去的回忆

412
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,790
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

413
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,790
很多新来的人在第一晚都几乎发疯了

414
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,090
Somebody always breaks down crying.

415
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,090
有些人甚至还痛哭流涕

416
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,190
Happens every time.

417
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,190
一向都如此的

418
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,890
The only question is

419
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,890
唯一的问题是

420
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,890
who's it going to be?

421
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,890
谁会是第一个呢?

422
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,190
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

423
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,190
我想那是用来赌博的最佳玩意

424
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,990
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

425
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,990
我把赌注押在安迪·德弗瑞恩身上

426
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,590
Lights out!

427
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,590
熄灯

428
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,490
I remember my first night.

429
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,490
我还记得我在这里的第一晚

430
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,290
Seems like a long time ago.

431
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,290
似乎是很久以前的事了

432
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,090
Hey, fish.

433
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,090
嗨 新来的

434
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,890
Fish, fish.

435
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,890
新来的

436
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,290
What are you, scared of the dark?

437
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,290
你怕黑吗?

438
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,290
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!

439
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,290
我打赌 你希望你爸和你妈从没把你生下来

440
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,990
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

441
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,990
蠢猪!

442
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,490
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.

443
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,490
他们总是喜欢逗新人

444
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,790
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.

445
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,790
不达目的 誓不罢休

446
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,790
Hey, Fat Ass.

447
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,790
嗨 胖子

448
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,590
Fat Ass!

449
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,590
胖子!

450
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,490
Talk to me, boy.

451
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,490
聊天吧

452
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

453
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,890
我知道你在那里 我能听见你的呼吸声

454
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,090
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?

455
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,090
别理别人怎么说 你听到吗?

456
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,190
This place ain't so bad.

457
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,190
这地方没那么差劲

458
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,890
Tell you what

459
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,890
这样吧

460
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,290
I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.

461
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,290
我介绍你认识他们 就像一家人

462
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,790
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just

463
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,790
我知道有几个人

464
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,990
Iove to make your acquaintance.

465
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,990
会很乐意认识你的

466
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,690
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.

467
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,690
尤其是你那又白又嫩的屁股

468
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,990
God!

469
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,990
天啊!

470
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,090
I don't belong here!

471
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,090
我不属于这里

472
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,090
We have a winner! I want to go home!

473
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,090
嗨 有人赢了 我要回家

474
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,990
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

475
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,990
是胖子

476
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,590
Fresh fish!

477
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,590
新人!

478
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,490
I want to go home!

479
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,490
我要回家

480
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,690
I want my mother!

481
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,690
我要见我妈妈

482
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,190
I had your mother! She wasn't that great!

483
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,190
我操过你妈妈!她不怎么样

484
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,490
What the Christ is this horseshit?

485
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,490
发生了什么事?

486
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,790
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

487
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,790
他讲粗话 我要告诉典狱官

488
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,390
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

489
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,390
告诉他我操你屁股吧

490
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,490
Let me out!

491
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,490
让我出去

492
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,090
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

493
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,090
胖子 你想怎么样?

494
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,290
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

495
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,290
求求你!我不该在这里的

496
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,790
Not me!

497
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,790
不该是我

498
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,390
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

499
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,390
我不会警告你的

500
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,590
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

501
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,590
马上你闭上你的臭嘴 否则有你受的!

502
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,890
Shut up, man. Shut up!

503
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,890
闭嘴 闭嘴 求求你

504
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,290
You don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.

505
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,290
你不明白的 我不该在这里的

506
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,790
Open that cell.

507
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,790
把囚笼打开

508
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,190
Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!

509
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,190
我也是!这里被他们弄得就像监狱

510
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,690
Son of a bitch!

511
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,690
狗娘养的

512
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,990
Captain, take it easy!

513
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,990
长官 算了

514
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,590
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight

515
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,590
如果我今晚听到有半点声音

516
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,290
I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

517
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,290
我对天发誓 你们会吃不了兜着走

518
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,090
Every last motherfucker in here.

519
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,090
所有的人都不会放过的

520
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,190
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

521
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,190
把他抬到医疗室去

522
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,190
His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

523
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,190
德福瑞恩第一晚就让我输了两包烟

524
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,390
He never made a sound.

525
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,390
他整晚一言不发

526
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,090
Tier 3 north, clear count!

527
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,090
北仓三楼 出来

528
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,790
Tier 2 north, clear count.

529
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,790
北仓二楼 出来

530
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,690
Tier 3 south, clear.

531
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,690
南仓三楼 出来

532
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,090
Prepare to roll out.

533
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,090
准备出来放风

534
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,190
Roll out!

535
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,190
出去!

536
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,290
Are you going to eat that?

537
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,290
你准备吃那个吗?

538
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,190
I hadn't planned on it.

539
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,190
不 我没这打算

540
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,490
Do you mind?

541
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,490
你介意吗?

542
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,490
That's nice and ripe.

543
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,490
你真不错

544
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,290
Jake says thank you.

545
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,290
杰克说谢谢你

546
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,990
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

547
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,990
它从巢里掉下来了

548
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,790
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

549
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,790
我要照顾它直到它会飞为止

550
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,690
Oh, no! Here he comes.

551
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,690
不!他过来了

552
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,490
Morning, fellas.

553
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,490
早上好 各位

554
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,690
Fine morning, isn't it?

555
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,690
不错的早晨 不是吗?

556
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,190
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

557
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,190
你们知道我的意思的 对吗?

558
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,690
Send them down. I want them lined up

559
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:19,690
把它们拿出来 把它们排成排

560
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,590
just like a pretty little chorus line.

561
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,590
非常诱人的一行

562
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,890
Look at that.

563
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,890
看看这个

564
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,590
I can't stand this guy. Oh, Lord!

565
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,590
我真受不了了

566
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,690
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

567
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,690
瑞查德、维吉尼亚

568
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,290
Smell my ass!

569
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,290
闻我的屁吧

570
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,490
After he smells mine.

571
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,490
再闻闻我的

572
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,590
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

573
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,590
很遗憾 你下注的那个输了

574
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,590
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

575
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:42,590
但我很喜欢我下注的那个人

576
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,390
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

577
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,390
我见到他就要亲他一下

578
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,990
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

579
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,990
你为何不把香烟分给他点?

580
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,090
Hey, Tyrell.

581
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,090
嗨 利奥

582
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,390
You pull infirmary duty this week?

583
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:54,390
这周你在医疗室当值是吗?

584
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,990
How's my horse doing anyway?

585
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,990
我下注的那个怎么样了?

586
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,490
Dead.

587
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,490
死了

588
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,490
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

589
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,490
哈德利打爆了他的头

590
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,890
Doc had gone home for the night.

591
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,890
晚上医生都回家了

592
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,690
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

593
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,690
可怜的家伙就在那里躺到早上

594
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,390
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

595
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,390
可是那时我们已经无能为力了

596
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,990
What was his name?

597
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,990
他叫什么?

598
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,590
What'd you say?

599
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,590
你说什么?

600
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,890
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

601
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,890
我只是想问有人知道他的名字吗?

602
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,390
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

603
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,390
关你屁事 新来的?

604
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,490
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.

605
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,490
他叫什么都无所谓了 他已经死了

606
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,490
Anybody come at you yet?

607
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,490
嗨 有人和你一起吗?

608
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,490
Anybody get to you yet?

609
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,490
有人喜欢你吗?

610
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,690
Hey, we all need friends in here.

611
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,690
嗨 在这里我们都需要朋友

612
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,690
I could be a friend to you.

613
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,690
我可以做你的朋友

614
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,290
Hard to get.

615
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,290
难得手

616
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,890
I like that.

617
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,890
我喜欢

618
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,090
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

619
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,090
安迪一开始很自闭

620
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,390
I guess he had a lot on his mind

621
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,390
我猜他在想办法

622
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,690
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

623
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,690
接受牢里的生活

624
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,590
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth

625
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,590
一个月以后他才开口

626
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,190
to say more than two words to somebody.

627
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,190
和某人谈话

628
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,890
As it turned out

629
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,890
就像你们所看见的

630
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,290
that somebody was me.

631
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,290
那个人就是我

632
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,790
I'm Andy Dufresne.

633
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,790
我是安迪·德福瑞恩

634
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,790
Wife-killing banker.

635
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,790
杀妻的银行家

636
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,390
Why'd you do it?

637
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:06,390
你为何要杀你的妻子?

638
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,790
I didn't, since you ask.

639
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,790
我没有杀她

640
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,290
You're going to fit right in.

641
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,290
你很适应合这里

642
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,190
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

643
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:14,190
这儿每个人都是无辜的 你不知道吗?

644
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,990
What you in here for? Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

645
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,990
你为进监狱? 我什么都没做 律师害了我

646
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,590
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

647
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,590
听说你很冷酷

648
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,390
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

649
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,390
你以为自己很了不起 对吗?

650
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,090
What do you think?

651
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,090
你怎么认为呢?

652
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,490
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

653
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:32,490
说实话 我还不知道

654
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,490
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

655
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,490
我知道你能拿到违禁品

656
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,790
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

657
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,790
我能搞到

658
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,490
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

659
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,490
你能给我个鹤嘴槌吗?

660
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,490
A rock hammer.

661
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,490
鹤嘴槌

662
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,590
What is it and why? What do you care?

663
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,590
要干什么? 你关心这个干吗?

664
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,590
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.

665
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,590
如果是牙刷我就不会问你 我会开个价钱

666
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,290
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

667
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,290
但是牙刷没有杀伤力 对吗?

668
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,190
Fair enough.

669
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,190
有道理

670
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,290
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

671
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,290
一个鹤嘴槌有六至七英寸长

672
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,790
Looks like a miniature pickax. Pickax?

673
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,790
看起来像个小锄子 锄子?

674
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,190
For rocks.

675
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,190
打石用的

676
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,090
Quartz?

677
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,090
石英 石英?

678
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,490
And some mica, shale

679
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,490
还有云母、页岩

680
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,990
limestone.

681
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,990
石灰岩

682
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,390
So?

683
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,390
这么说吧

684
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,090
So I'm a rock hound.

685
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,090
我收集石头

686
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,690
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.

687
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,690
我想在这里最大限度的重操旧业

688
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,090
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

689
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,090
或许你想用它们攻击某人

690
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,090
No, I have no enemies here.

691
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,090
不 我在这里没有敌人

692
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,590
No? Wait a while.

693
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,590
不会?等着瞧吧

694
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,790
Word gets around.

695
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,790
话说回来

696
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,990
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

697
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,990
那对姐妹花很喜欢你

698
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,190
Especially Bogs.

699
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,190
特别是伯格斯

700
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,590
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

701
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,590
就算跟他们说我不好此道也没用

702
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,290
Neither are they.

703
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,290
他们也不是

704
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,890
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

705
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,890
是这个地方让他们这样

706
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,790
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.

707
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,790
畜牲只知道用暴力 不管他人喜不喜欢

708
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,590
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

709
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,590
如果我是你 我会加倍小心

710
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,490
Thanks for the advice. Well, that's free.

711
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,490
谢谢你的忠告 忠告免费

712
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,790
You understand my concern.

713
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,790
你知道我担心什么

714
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,590
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

715
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,590
就算我有麻烦也不会用鹤嘴槌的

716
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,590
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

717
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,590
那我猜你想挖个洞逃出去

718
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,190
What did I miss? What's so funny?

719
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,190
我说漏了什么?什么东西这么好笑

720
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,290
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

721
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,290
等你看见鹤嘴槌你就明白了

722
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,390
What's an item like this usually go for?

723
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,390
买这个东西一般要多少钱?

724
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,090
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

725
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,090
七美元 五金铺的零售价

726
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,990
My normal markup's 20 percent.

727
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,990
我一般要加20%

728
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,590
But this is a specialty item.

729
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,590
但这东西很特殊

730
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,290
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

731
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,290
风险越大 价钱越高 一口价 10元吧

732
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,790
Ten it is.

733
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,790
就10元吧

734
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,590
Waste of money, if you ask me.

735
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,590
你那是浪费钱

736
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,090
Why's that?

737
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,090
为什么?

738
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,590
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

739
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,590
这里的人喜欢突击检查

740
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,190
They find it, you're going to lose it.

741
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:58,190
他们找到鹤嘴槌就会被充公

742
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,490
If they catch you, you don't know me.

743
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,490
被他们发现的话 你别把我供出来

744
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,890
Mention my name, we never do business again.

745
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,890
否则的话就别想

746
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,490
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?

747
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,490
再和我做生意了 你明白了吗?

748
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,890
I understand.

749
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,890
我知道了

750
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,190
Thank you, Mr...?

751
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,190
谢谢你 你叫...?

752
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,390
Red.

753
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,390
瑞德

754
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,490
Name's Red.

755
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,490
都叫我瑞德

756
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,490
Why do they call you that?

757
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,490
这名字怎么来的?

758
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,290
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

759
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,290
可能因为我是半个爱尔兰人吧

760
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,390
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

761
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,390
我现在明白他们为何看中他了

762
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,690
He had a quiet way about him

763
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,690
他不太说话

764
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,990
a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

765
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,990
一举一动都不像普通的人

766
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,990
He strolled

767
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,990
他漫步着

768
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,190
like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

769
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,190
就像在公园里散步

770
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,190
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

771
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,190
像穿了件隐形的外套

772
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,390
I think it'd be fair to say

773
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,390
可以说

774
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,890
I liked Andy from the start.

775
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,890
开始我对安迪就有好感

776
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,290
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.

777
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:06,290
快点! 我赶时间的

778
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,090
Move it! Come on, move it!

779
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,090
快点

780
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,590
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?

781
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,590
你太太对你好吗?

782
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,190
Andy was right.

783
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,190
安迪说得很对

784
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,690
I finally got the joke.

785
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,690
我最终拿到那玩意

786
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,390
It would take a man about 600 years

787
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:02,390
用这东西来挖隧道

788
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,090
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

789
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,090
起码要花六百年

790
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,290
- Book? - Not today.

791
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,290
- 要书吗? - 今天不用了

792
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,290
Book?

793
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,290
要书吗?

794
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,790
Delivery for Dufresne.

795
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,790
送到德福瑞恩那里去

796
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,090
Here's your book.

797
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,090
德福瑞恩 这是你要的书

798
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,390
Thanks.

799
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,390
谢谢

800
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,290
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

801
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,290
漂白粉不够用了 你再去后面拿点来

802
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,190
This will blind you.

803
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,190
这可以弄瞎你的眼睛

804
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,990
Honey, hush.

805
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,990
亲爱的

806
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,490
That's it. You fight!

807
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,490
你不懂

808
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,190
Better that way.

809
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,190
你越挣扎越过瘾

810
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,490
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight

811
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,490
我很想说安迪打赢了

812
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,690
and the Sisters let him be.

813
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:14,690
或者姐妹花放过了他

814
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,090
I wish I could tell you that

815
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,090
我希望能这么说

816
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,290
but prison is no fairy-tale world.

817
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,290
但是监狱不是童话世界

818
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,390
He never said who did it.

819
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,390
他从没提起是谁

820
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,190
But we all knew.

821
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,190
但我们都很清楚

822
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,590
Things went on like that for a while.

823
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,590
事情就这样持续了一段时间

824
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,490
Prison life consists of routine

825
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,490
监狱里的生活都是常规

826
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,690
and then more routine.

827
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,690
和更多的常规

828
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,690
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

829
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,690
安迪的脸上经常出现新的伤痕

830
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,990
The Sisters kept at him.

831
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:46,990
姐妹花不断地骚扰他

832
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,290
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

833
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,290
有时候他能逃脱

834
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,990
Sometimes not.

835
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,990
但有时不能

836
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,390
And that's how it went for Andy.

837
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,390
对安迪来说

838
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,690
That was his routine.

839
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,690
这已经成了他的常规

840
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,990
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

841
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,990
我相信最初的两年是最糟糕的

842
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,890
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way

843
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:04,890
我也相信事情再继续这样下去

844
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,590
this place would have got the best of him.

845
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,590
这个地方会夺去他的精神

846
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,190
But then, in the spring of 1949

847
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,190
但是 在1949年的春天

848
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,290
the powers that be decided:

849
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,290
上头决定

850
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,790
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

851
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,790
工厂的屋顶需要重修

852
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,190
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

853
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,190
我需要12名自愿者工作一星期

854
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,390
As you know

855
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,390
你们知道的

856
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,690
special detail carries with it special privileges.

857
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:26,690
特殊的工作有特殊的好处

858
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,290
It was outdoor detail

859
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,290
这是户外劳动

860
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,990
and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

861
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,990
五月是户外劳动的好时间

862
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,590
Stay in line there.

863
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,590
排好队

864
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,890
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

865
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,890
超过100人报名参加劳动

866
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,190
Wallace E. Unger.

867
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,190
威勒斯·E·安戈

868
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,090
Ellis Redding.

869
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,090
艾力斯·瑞丁

870
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,790
Wouldn't you know it?

871
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,790
你明白了吧?

872
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,590
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

873
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,590
我和几个我认识的都被选中了

874
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,790
Andrew Dufresne.

875
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,790
安迪·德福瑞恩

876
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,090
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

877
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,090
这只花了我们每人一包烟的代价

878
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,090
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

879
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:03,090
我当然也像往常一样赚了20%

880
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,790
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

881
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,790
德州的律师打长途给我

882
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,490
I say, "Yeah?"

883
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,490
我说 "喂?"

884
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,390
He says, " Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

885
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,390
他说 "很遗憾 你哥哥死了"

886
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,490
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.

887
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,490
- 我很难过 - 我并不难过 他是个混蛋

888
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,890
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.

889
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,890
离家多年 早就当他死了

890
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,390
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

891
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,390
这个律师对我说

892
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,590
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

893
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,590
"他死的时候很富有" 有价值超过百万的油井

894
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,290
A million bucks?

895
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,290
超过百万的?

896
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,090
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?

897
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,090
- 有些混蛋的运气有时候就是好 - 有你的份吗?

898
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,490
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.

899
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,490
三万五千块 那就他留给我的

900
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,890
- Dollars? - Yeah

901
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,890
- 美元? - 对

902
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,590
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.

903
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,590
真不错 就像中了彩

904
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,090
Isn't it?

905
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,090
不是吗?

906
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,190
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?

907
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,190
笨蛋 你想政府会如何对我?

908
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,790
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

909
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,790
他们会拿去一大半

910
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,890
Poor Byron.

911
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,890
可怜的布朗

912
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,990
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

913
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,990
真是走运 嗯?奇耻大辱

914
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,390
Some people really got it awful.

915
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,390
有些人觉得很糟糕

916
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,090
Andy, are you nuts?

917
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,090
安迪 你傻了吗?

918
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,190
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

919
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,190
看着你的拖把 嘿!

920
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,390
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up

921
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,390
虽然要交点税 但你还可以

922
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,390
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?

923
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,390
也许够买辆新车 但接着呢?

924
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,290
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair, maintenance

925
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,290
你必须为新车上该死的税 维修和保养

926
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,690
kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

927
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,690
孩子们会缠着你带着他们兜风

928
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,590
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

929
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,590
如果年底算错了税金 还要掏自己的腰包

930
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,890
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

931
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,890
告诉你! 山姆叔叔

932
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,190
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

933
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,190
他只是假仁假义

934
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,990
Getting himself killed. Keep tarring.

935
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,990
他在找死 继续干活吧

936
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,690
Some brother. Shit!

937
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,690
什么兄弟 呸!

938
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,090
Mr. Hadley

939
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,090
哈德利先生

940
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,290
do you trust your wife?

941
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:40,290
你信任你太太吗?

942
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,390
Oh, that's funny.

943
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,390
噢 这很有趣

944
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,590
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

945
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:46,590
你给我挨揍的话也许更有趣

946
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,090
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?

947
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,090
我是说 你是否会认为她对你不忠?

948
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,590
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.

949
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,590
让开点 米特 让他自己出意外

950
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,890
He'll push him off!

951
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,890
他会把他推下去的

952
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,990
If you trust her, you can keep

953
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,990
如果你信任她 你就能

954
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,590
that 35,000.

955
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,590
拿到三万五千元

956
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,590
- What did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.

957
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:03,590
- 你说什么? - 三万五千元

958
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,690
All of it.

959
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,690
一分不少

960
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,990
Every penny. You better start making sense.

961
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,990
你最好说明白点 小子 不然你完蛋了

962
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,490
If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.

963
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,490
你要拿到这笔钱的话 就把它送给你妻子

964
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,590
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

965
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,590
政府允许一次性赠与配偶金额的上限是六万美元

966
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,190
- Bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.

967
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,190
- 胡扯!免税的吗? - 免税的

968
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,390
IRS can't touch one cent.

969
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,390
国税局一毛钱也拿不走

970
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,190
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.

971
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,190
你是那个谋杀妻子的银行家吗?

972
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,790
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?

973
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,790
我为何要相信你?我会在这杀了你!

974
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,890
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.

975
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,890
这是合法的 你可以去问国税局 他们会给你同样的回答

976
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,090
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.

977
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:33,090
我知道即使我不告诉你 你也能查到的

978
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,990
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

979
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,990
我不需要你来教我怎么做

980
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,590
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.

981
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,590
当然 但你需要有人帮你逃税

982
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,390
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

983
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,390
你需要请一个律师

984
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,790
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

985
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,790
那些华盛顿的混蛋?

986
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,790
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

987
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:48,790
我想我能帮你 那你就能省点钱

988
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,090
You get the forms, I'll prepare them

989
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,090
我帮你填好文件

990
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,990
nearly free of charge.

991
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,990
几乎是免费的

992
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,590
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

993
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,590
我只要求给每个同事三瓶啤酒

994
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,090
"Coworkers." That's rich!

995
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,090
同事?你真的发达了

996
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,390
A man working outdoors feels more like a man

997
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,390
一个户外工作的人能有啤酒喝的话

998
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,090
if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion

999
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,090
会感觉更像一个男人 那是我的意见

1000
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,490
sir.

1001
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,490
长官

1002
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,390
What are you jimmies staring at?

1003
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,390
你们在看什么?

1004
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,190
Let's go! Work!

1005
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:16,190
继续干活

1006
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,690
And that's how it came to pass

1007
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,690
就这样

1008
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,490
that on the second-to-last day of the job

1009
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,490
在完工前的第二天

1010
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,290
the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49

1011
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,290
在49年的春天里 一群在工厂上面装修的罪犯

1012
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,590
wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning

1013
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,590
早上十点坐在屋顶上

1014
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,290
drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw

1015
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,290
享受着清凉的啤酒和肖申克最严密的保护

1016
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,790
that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

1017
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:47,790
这种事在肖申克从没有发生

1018
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,390
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

1019
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:50,390
趁凉喝 女士们

1020
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,090
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

1021
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,090
他还装作很大度似的走来走去

1022
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,690
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

1023
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,690
我们坐着喝着啤酒 阳光洒在肩头 觉得是个自由人

1024
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,490
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

1025
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,490
感觉就像在装修自己家的屋项

1026
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,490
We were the lords of all creation.

1027
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,490
我们就像造物主

1028
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,690
As for Andy

1029
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,690
安迪看起来

1030
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,590
he spent that break hunkered in the shade

1031
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:13,590
也有点不同了

1032
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,290
a strange little smile on his face

1033
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,290
他脸上露出奇怪的笑容

1034
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,690
watching us drink his beer.

1035
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,690
望着我们喝他的啤酒

1036
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,190
Want a cold one?

1037
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,190
要来点吗?

1038
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,790
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

1039
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,790
不 谢谢 我戒酒了

1040
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,790
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.

1041
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,790
如果他不和狱警打交道

1042
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,290
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

1043
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,290
或许就不能和我们交上朋友

1044
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,090
Me?

1045
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,090
我?

1046
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,090
I think he did it just to feel normal again

1047
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:48,090
我觉得他这样做只是为了在此感到自由

1048
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,790
if only for a short while.

1049
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,790
哪怕只是一小会儿

1050
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,490
King me.

1051
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,490
将军

1052
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,990
Chess. Now there's a game of kings. What?

1053
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,990
象棋 这是一个王者的游戏 什么?

1054
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,990
Civilized. Strategic.

1055
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,990
文明 战略

1056
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,590
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

1057
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,590
我一点都没察觉 我讨厌这样

1058
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,690
Let me teach you someday.

1059
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,690
改天我教教你吧

1060
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,190
Sure.

1061
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,190
好的

1062
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,390
We could get a board together.

1063
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,390
或许你我可合作

1064
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,690
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?

1065
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:14,690
你找对人了 我能弄到很多东西

1066
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,890
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

1067
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,890
我们可以合作做买卖 我来雕刻

1068
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,390
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?

1069
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,390
一面是石膏像 另一面是肥皂石 你觉得怎样?

1070
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,390
I think it'll take years.

1071
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,390
这需要很多时间

1072
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,190
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

1073
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:27,190
时间不是问题 只是没有石头

1074
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,390
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

1075
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,390
操场里拾到的都是小石头

1076
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,390
Pebbles, mostly.

1077
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,390
大多是鹅卵石

1078
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,490
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

1079
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:38,490
安迪 我们是朋友 对吗?

1080
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,990
Yeah, I guess.

1081
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,990
我想是的

1082
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,090
Can I ask you something?

1083
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,090
我能问你个问题吗?

1084
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,990
Why'd you do it?

1085
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,990
你为何要杀你妻子?

1086
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,790
I'm innocent, Red.

1087
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,790
我是清白的 瑞德

1088
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,090
Just like everybody else here.

1089
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,090
就像这狱中其他人一样

1090
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,990
What are you in for?

1091
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:56,990
你怎会进来的?

1092
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,790
Murder. Same as you.

1093
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,790
和你一样 是谋杀

1094
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,190
Innocent?

1095
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,190
清白的?

1096
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,290
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

1097
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:08,290
肖申克监狱里唯一有罪的一个

1098
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,090
Where's the canary?

1099
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,090
金丝雀在哪里?

1100
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,590
How did you know?

1101
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,590
你怎么知道的?

1102
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,190
How did I know what? So you don't know.

1103
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,190
我怎么知道? 原来你不知道

1104
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,490
Come.

1105
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,490
来

1106
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,090
This is where the canary is.

1107
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,090
金丝雀就在那里

1108
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,090
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?

1109
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,090
在我家听到女人唱歌很惊讶是吗?

1110
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,990
That's quite a

1111
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,990
那确实令我

1112
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,590
surprise.

1113
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,590
很惊讶

1114
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,290
Wait, wait.

1115
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,290
等等

1116
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,390
Here she comes.

1117
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,390
她出场了

1118
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,490
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

1119
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,490
我最爱看她摆弄头发那场戏

1120
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,390
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

1121
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,390
我知道 这个月已经看了三遍了

1122
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,590
Gilda, are you decent?

1123
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,590
吉达 你好吗?

1124
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,690
Me?

1125
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,690
我?

1126
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,190
God, I love it.

1127
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,190
天啊 我喜欢这场戏

1128
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,290
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

1129
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,290
我明白你什么都弄得到

1130
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,090
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

1131
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,090
是的 要什么有什么 你要什么?

1132
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,390
Rita Hayworth. What?

1133
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,390
丽塔·海华丝 什么?

1134
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,290
Can you get her?

1135
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,290
你能找到她吗?

1136
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,090
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

1137
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:17,090
你就是强尼吗 久闻大名了

1138
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,690
Take a few weeks. Weeks?

1139
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:20,690
要几个星期的时间 几个星期?

1140
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,290
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

1141
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:25,290
很抱歉 现在她又没有坐在我的大腿上

1142
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,190
But I'll get her.

1143
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,190
但我能找到的

1144
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,690
Relax.

1145
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,690
放松些

1146
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,890
Thanks.

1147
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,890
谢谢

1148
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,190
Get out! I got to change reels!

1149
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,190
滚出去! 我要换带子了

1150
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,390
I said fuck off!

1151
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,390
我说了 滚出去

1152
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,990
Ain't you going to scream?

1153
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,990
你打算大叫吗?

1154
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,190
Let's get this over with.

1155
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,190
让我们做个了结吧

1156
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,290
He broke my fucking nose!

1157
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,290
他打爆了我的鼻子

1158
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,790
Now

1159
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:24,790
现在

1160
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,390
I'm going to open my fly

1161
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,390
我要拉开拉链

1162
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,490
and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

1163
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,490
我给你什么吃你就吃下什么

1164
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,190
Then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.

1165
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,190
然后再吃罗斯的 你打爆了他的鼻子

1166
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,590
He ought to have something to show for it.

1167
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,590
他该得到点补偿

1168
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,590
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

1169
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,590
我会咬断任何放进我嘴里的东西

1170
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,390
No, you don't understand.

1171
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,390
不 你还没明白

1172
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,790
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

1173
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:44,790
你那样做的话我就把刀插进你的耳朵

1174
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,490
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury

1175
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,490
好吧 但你得知道突如其来的脑部撞击

1176
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,590
causes the victim to bite down hard.

1177
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,590
会令受害人剧烈反应

1178
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,290
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong

1179
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,290
事实上 我听说受害者会咬紧牙关

1180
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,590
they have to pry the victim's jaws open

1181
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,590
要用铁棍

1182
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,190
with a crowbar.

1183
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,190
才能撬开他的嘴巴

1184
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,590
Where do you get this shit?

1185
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,590
你怎么知道的?

1186
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,290
I read it.

1187
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,290
从书里看到的

1188
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,290
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

1189
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,290
你不会看书? 白痴?

1190
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,090
Honey!

1191
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:12,090
亲爱的

1192
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,790
You shouldn't!

1193
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,790
你不应该这样的

1194
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,290
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

1195
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:21,290
伯格斯没有把任何东西放进安迪的嘴里

1196
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,690
And neither did his friends.

1197
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,690
他的朋友们也没有

1198
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,890
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

1199
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:27,890
他们只是把他揍了个半死

1200
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,090
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

1201
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,090
安迪在疗养院里整整躺了一个月

1202
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,390
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

1203
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,390
伯格斯则被锁进黑房关了一周

1204
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,090
Time's up, Bogs.

1205
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,090
伯格斯 时间到了

1206
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,490
It's your world, boss.

1207
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,490
遵命 头

1208
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,590
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

1209
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,590
回到你的囚仓 等着查房

1210
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,490
All prisoners report for lock down.

1211
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,490
所有犯人返回囚房

1212
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,390
What?

1213
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,390
什么事?

1214
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,590
Where's he going? Grab his ankles.

1215
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,590
他要到哪里去? 抓住他

1216
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,690
Help!

1217
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:32,690
救命

1218
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,890
Two things never happened again after that.

1219
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:38,890
之后 有两件事再也没发生过了

1220
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,290
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

1221
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:42,290
姐妹花再也不敢惹安迪了

1222
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,690
And Bogs would never walk again.

1223
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,690
而伯格斯再也没有站起来

1224
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,390
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

1225
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,390
他被送到一个特殊医院去

1226
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,290
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days

1227
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:53,290
据我所知 他在下半生中

1228
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,390
drinking his food through a straw.

1229
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,390
都只能靠饮筒来进食

1230
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,390
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

1231
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:00,390
我想给安迪开个欢迎会庆祝他复原

1232
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,790
Sounds good to us.

1233
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,790
听起来很不错

1234
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,490
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

1235
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,490
啤酒的事我们还欠他的情

1236
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,490
The man likes to play chess.

1237
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,490
他喜欢下象棋

1238
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,990
Let's get him some rocks.

1239
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,990
给他找点石头吧

1240
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,790
Guys!

1241
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:45,790
伙计们

1242
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,590
I got one.

1243
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,590
我找到一块

1244
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,290
I got one. Look!

1245
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:49,290
我找到一块 看

1246
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,290
Heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.

1247
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,290
希伍德 那不是皂石 也不是石膏

1248
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,590
What are you, a fucking geologist?

1249
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,590
你们他妈的是地质学家吗?

1250
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,590
He's right. It ain't.

1251
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:59,590
他是对的 这不是我们要找的

1252
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,490
- What the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.

1253
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,490
- 这到底是什么? - 粪球

1254
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,990
- Bullshit! - No, horseshit.

1255
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,990
- 胡扯! - 不 是马粪

1256
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,990
Petrified.

1257
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,990
晒干了的

1258
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,990
Damn!

1259
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,990
他妈的

1260
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,490
Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.

1261
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,490
不久 他们开始认识石头

1262
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,390
And by the weekend he was due back

1263
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,390
当安迪在周末回来的时候

1264
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,390
we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.

1265
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,390
我们已经找到足够多的石头让他忙个不停

1266
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,690
Also got a big shipment in that week.

1267
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,690
那个星期我也收到很大批货

1268
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,090
Cigarettes

1269
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,090
香烟

1270
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,290
chewing gum

1271
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,290
口香糖

1272
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,990
sipping whisky

1273
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,990
威土忌

1274
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,590
playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.

1275
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:39,590
画着裸女的扑克牌

1276
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,490
And of course, the most important item:

1277
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,490
当然 最重要的是

1278
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,490
Rita Hayworth herself.

1279
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,490
丽塔·海华丝

1280
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,390
"欢迎归来 免费享用"

1281
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,790
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

1282
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,790
注意 要查房了

1283
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,790
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

1284
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,790
注意 要查房了

站起来

1291
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,790
Face the wall.

1292
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,790
面向墙站好

1293
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,790
Turn around and face the warden.

1294
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,790
转过身面向典狱长

1295
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,490
Pleased to see you reading this.

1296
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:35,490
很高兴看见你在看这本书

1297
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,790
Any favorite passages?

特别喜欢哪一章?

1299

"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not

1300
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,990
看到你 就知道

1301
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,390
when the master of the house cometh."

1302
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:44,390
你是精神之主

马可福音第十三章三十五节

1305
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,290
I've always liked that one.

1306
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,290
我一向都喜欢那一章

1307
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,890
But I prefer

1308
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,890
但我更喜欢

1309
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,290
" I am the light of the world.

1310
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,290
我是世界的光

1311
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,990
Ye that followeth me shall have the light of life."

1312
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,990
跟随我就不会步入黑暗 而能得到生命的光

约瑟福音第八章第十二节

1315
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,190
I hear you're good with numbers.

1316
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,190
我听说你精通数学

1317
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,390
How nice.

1318
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,390
不错

1319
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,590
Man should have a skill.

1320
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,590
人总得有一技之长

1321
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,090
Explain this.

1322
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,090
这个你怎么解释

1323
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,290
It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

1324
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,290
这是纱纸 打磨石头用的

1325
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,690
A little hobby of mine.

1326
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,690
这是我的小嗜好

1327
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,990
It's pretty clean.

1328
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,990
相当干净

1329
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,390
Some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.

1330
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,390
看来没什么古怪的

1331
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,690
I can't say I approve of this.

1332
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,690
这是未经我批准的

1333
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,790
But I suppose

1334
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:44,790
但是

1335
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,890
exceptions can be made.

1336
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,890
凡事总有例外

1337
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,590
Lock them up!

1338
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:00,590
锁门!

1339
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,090
I almost forgot.

1340
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,090
差点忘记了

1341
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,690
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

1342
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:07,690
我不能取走它的

1343
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,390
Salvation lies within.

1344
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,390
救赎之道就在其中

1345
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,590
Yes, sir.

1346
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,590
是的 先生

1347
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,690
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

1348
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,690
查房其实只是个藉口

1349
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,390
Truth is

1350
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:24,390
事实上

1351
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,090
Norton wanted to size Andy up.

1352
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:27,090
诺顿是想考察一下

1353
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,190
"主的审判迅速降临"

1354
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,090
My wife made that in church group.

1355
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:43,090
我太太在教堂做的

1356
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,090
Very nice, sir.

1357
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,090
很不错 先生

1358
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,090
You enjoy working the laundry?

1359
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,090
喜欢洗衣房的工作吗?

1360
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,490
No, sir. Not especially.

1361
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:53,490
不 先生 不是特别喜欢

1362
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,290
Perhaps we can find something more

1363
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,290
或许我们能做点别的

1364
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,990
befitting a man of your education.

1365
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,990
利用你的学识

1366
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,490
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

1367
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,490
杰克 布鲁斯呢?

1368
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,090
I thought I heard you out here.

1369
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:13,090
安迪 我听到你来了

1370
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,390
I've been reassigned to you.

1371
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,390
我来跟你工作

1372
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,990
I know, they told me.

1373
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,990
我知道 他们跟我说了

1374
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,890
Ain't that a kick in the head?

1375
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,890
也是被踢伤的吗?

1376
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,390
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

1377
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,390
我来带你看看吧

1378
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,790
Come on.

1379
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,790
来吧

1380
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,890
Well, here she is.

1381
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,890

1396
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:49,890
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

1397

名字写在这板上

1398
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,190
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

1399
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:53,190
很容易的工作

1400
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,790
Any questions? How long have you been librarian?

1401
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:56,790
有问题吗? 你当了多久的图书管理员

1402
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,990
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

1403
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:01,990
我1905年入狱 1912年在此工作

1404
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,490
And have you ever had an assistant?

1405
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,490
你一直都有助手吗?

1406
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,190
No. Not much to it, really.

1407
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,190
没有 工作不是那么忙

1408
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,190
Why me? Why now?

1409
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,190
那为什么现在让我来?

1410
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,890
I don't know.

1411
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:11,890
我不知道

1412
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,190
But it'd be nice to have some company down here.

1413
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:15,190
但我很高兴有个伴

1414
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,690
That's him. That's the one.

1415
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,690
就是他

1416
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,490
I'm Dekins.

1417
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,490
我叫迪格斯

1418
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,590
I was thinking

1419
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,590
我想

1420
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,090
about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

1421
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,090
为儿子申请助学金

1422
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,490
I see.

1423
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,490
我明白了

1424
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,590
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

1425
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:57,590
坐下来谈好吗?

1426
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,690
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

1427
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,690
布鲁斯 你有纸和笔吗?

1428
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,390
Thanks.

1429
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,390
谢谢

1430
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,090
So

1431
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,090
那么

1432
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,590
Mister Dekins

1433
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,590
迪格斯先生

1434
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,490
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins

1435
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,490
接着安迪问迪格斯

1436
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,690
do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

1437
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:27,690
你想让你的儿子去哈佛还是耶鲁?

1438
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,990
He didn't say that!

1439
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:28,990
他没有这样说

1440
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,790
As God as my witness!

1441
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,790
上帝可以作证

1442
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,790
Dekins blinked for a second

1443
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:33,790
迪格斯愣了一会儿

1444
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,190
then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

1445
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:37,190
傻笑着和安迪握手

1446
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,890
My ass! Shook his hand.

1447
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,890
老天!和他握手

1448
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,990
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

1449
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,990
我告诉你们 我感到

1450
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,490
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk

1451
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,490
安迪若穿上那套衣服

1452
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,290
he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

1453
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,290
他就会变成德福瑞恩先生的了

1454
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,090
Making a few friends?

1455
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,090
安迪 又交上新朋友了?

1456
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,090
I wouldn't say "friends."

1457
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,090
我不认为是朋友

1458
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,090
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

1459
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:59,090
我是一个能提供准确财政计划的谋杀犯

1460
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,690
It's a wonderful pet to have.

1461
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,690
只是某人不错的仆人

1462
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,690
Got you out of the laundry, though.

1463
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:03,690
至少可以令你离开洗衣房

1464
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,090
It might do more than that.

1465
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:06,090
可能不是那么简单的

1466
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,090
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.

1467
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,090
我打算扩大图书馆 找点新书

1468
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,890
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

1469
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,890
还是找张台球桌吧

1470
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,590
How do you expect to do that? I mean

1471
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,590
你打算怎么做 我是说

1472
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,690
get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

1473
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,690
怎么得到新书 向谁请求

1474
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,290
I'll ask the warden for funds.

1475
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,290
我会向典狱长要钱

1476
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,390
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned

1477
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,390
噢 孩子 孩子 我经历了六个典狱长 懂得了一条

1478
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,890
one immutable, universal truth:

1479
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,890
一个事实 宇宙真理

1480
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,590
Not one born whose asshole

1481
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,590
那个人还没有生出来

1482
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:36,690
wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

1483
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:36,690
你向他们提出定遭拒绝的

1484
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,490
- The budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.

1485
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,490
- 预算不够用 - 我知道

1486
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,090
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.

1487
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,090
或许我写信向参议员提出

1488
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,290
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

1489
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:48,290
只有三种情况能动纳税人的钱

1490
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,090
More walls, more bars, more guards.

1491
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,090
多建围墙、多建牢房和增加守卫

1492
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,890
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.

1493
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,890
若你批准 我想尝试一下 每周一封信

1494
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,890
- They can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.

1495
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,890
- 他们不能永不理会 - 当然能够

1496
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,790
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

1497
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:59,790
如果你写着高兴那就写吧

1498
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,690
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

1499
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,690
我来替你寄出 怎样?

1500
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:07,190
So Andy started writing a letter a week

1501
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:07,190
就这样 安迪开始每周写一封信

1502
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,990
just like he said.

1503
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,990
就像他说得那样

1504
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,790
And like Norton said

1505
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,790
但如诺顿所说

1506
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,490
Andy got no answers.

1507
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,490
一直都无回覆

1508
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,590
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

1509
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:30,590
过了四月 安迪已帮半数狱警们报税

1510
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,390
Year after that, he did them all

1511
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,390
后来 全都找他帮忙了

1512
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,290
including the warden's.

1513
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,290
连典狱长纳税务都由他处理

1514
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,490
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season

1515
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:41,490
后来 他们安排

1516
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,190
to coincide with tax season.

1517
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,190
球队在税季中比赛

1518
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,190
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

1519
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,190
所有的球队都带着报税表

1520
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,790
So Moresby Prison

1521
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,790
所以莫尔斯比监狱

1522
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,190
issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

1523
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,190
配给你一支枪 但要你自己付钱

1524
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,190
Right. The holster too.

1525
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:56,190
对 连手枪皮套也是

1526
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,790
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

1527
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:58,790
那可以减免税款 你可把它记下来

1528
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,090
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

1529
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,090
是的!安迪就像一个正常的会计师

1530
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:07,290
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

1531
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:07,290
事实上 在税季中他如此的忙 允许有一个帮手

1532
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,990
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

1533
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,990
瑞德 你可以取1040号表格来吗?

1534
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,990
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

1535
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,990
每年有一个月离开监狱去木工场做工

1536
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,390
And still, he kept sending those letters.

1537
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:19,390
同时 安迪仍旧不断的写信

1538
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,290
Red、Andy, It's Brooks.

1539
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,290
瑞德、安迪 布鲁斯出事了

1540
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,890
Watch the door.

1541
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:29,890
看着门

1542
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,490
Please, Brooks.

1543
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:31,490
冷静点 布鲁斯

1544
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,490
Calm the fuck down. Stay back!

1545
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,490
千万别冲动 放下来!

1546
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,590
- Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?

1547
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,590
- 放下来 该死! - 发生什么事?

1548
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,390
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

1549
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,390
前一秒还好好的 他突然掏出刀来

1550
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,390
We can talk about this, right?

1551
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:41,390
有事慢慢商量好吗?

1552
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,390
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.

1553
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,390
没商量余地的 我要割断他的喉咙

1554
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,390
What's he done to you?

1555
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,390
他有什么对不起你?

1556
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,190
It's what they done!

1557
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,190
去问狱警吧

1558
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,990
I got no choice.

1559
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:50,990
我别无选择

1560
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,790
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.

1561
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,790
我们都知道 你不会伤害海伍德的

1562
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,490
- Right, Heywood? - Sure.

1563
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,490
- 对吗 海伍德? - 是的

1564
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,990
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

1565
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,990
他是你的朋友 布鲁斯是讲道理的

1566
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,390
Right, guys?

1567
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,390
对吗?

1568
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,890
So put the knife down. Look at me.

1569
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,890
那么把刀放下 看着我

1570
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,290
Put the knife down.

1571
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,290
把刀放下

1572
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,390
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

1573
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,390
看看他的脖子

1574
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,390
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

1575
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:14,390
看看他的脖子 他在流血

1576
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,790
It's the only way

1577
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:16,790
这是唯一

1578
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,090
they'd let me stay.

1579
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:19,090
使我留在这里的办法

1580
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,690
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

1581
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,690
你疯了 你不会这样做的

1582
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,990
Put it, put it down.

1583
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,990
放下 放下刀

1584
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,290
Take it easy.

1585
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,290
放松

1586
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,490
You'll be all right.

1587
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,490
一切都会好的

1588
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,190
Him? What about me?

1589
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,190
他?那么我呢?

1590
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,790
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

1591
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,790
这个愚蠢的疯子差点割断我的喉咙

1592
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,890
You've had worse from shaving.

1593
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,890
你就连刮胡子也比这刮得厉害

1594
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,190
What did you do to set him off?

1595
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,190
究竟怎么会这样?

1596
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,590
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

1597
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:48,590
没什么 我只是进来和他道别

1598
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,890
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

1599
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:51,890
难到你没听说?他获得假释

1600
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,990
I just don't understand what happened in there.

1601
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,990
我就是不明白 发生什么了

1602
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,990
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

1603
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:59,990
老家伙疯了

1604
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,090
That's enough out of you.

1605
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:02,090
够了

1606
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,090
- Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.

1607
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,090
- 我听说你吓得尿流 - 去你妈的

1608
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,490
Knock it off.

1609
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,490
不要说了!

1610
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,890
Brooks ain't no bug.

1611
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,890
布鲁斯不是疯了

1612
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,490
He's just institutionalized.

1613
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,490
他只是被体制化了

1614
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,790
"Institutionalized," my ass.

1615
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,790
体制化?什么东西?

1616
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,990
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!

1617
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,990
他在此已有五十年了 海伍德 五十年!

1618
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,990
This is all he knows.

1619
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,990
这是他唯一认识的地方

1620
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,490
In here, he's an important man

1621
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,490
在这儿 他是个重要的人

1622
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,790
an educated man.

1623
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:27,790
一个有教养的人

1624
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,490
Outside, he's nothing.

1625
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,490
在外面 他什么都不是

1626
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,790
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

1627
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,790
只是一个假释出来的囚犯

1628
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:38,090
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

1629
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:38,090
申请张借书证都有困难

1630
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,090
You know what I'm trying to say?

1631
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,090
你明白我说的话吗?

1632
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,290
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

1633
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,290
瑞德 我相信你说是屁话

1634
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,790
You believe whatever you want.

1635
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,790
怎么想随你吧

1636
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,790
But I tell you these walls are funny.

1637
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,790
我告诉你 这些围墙很有趣的

1638
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,990
First you hate them.

1639
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,990
开始 你痛恨周围的高墙

1640
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,790
Then you get used to them.

1641
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,790
慢慢的 你习惯生活在其中

1642
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,690
Enough time passes

1643
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,690
时间久了

1644
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,390
you get so you depend on them.

1645
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,390
你不得不依靠它而生存

1646
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,590
That's "institutionalized."

1647
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,590
那就是被体制化了

1648
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,090
I could never get like that. Oh, yeah?

1649
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,090
我永远不会那样的 对吗?

1650
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,390
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

1651
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,390
因为你没布鲁斯那样长时间在此

1652
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,190
Goddamn right.

1653
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:16,190
太对了

1654
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,690
They send you here for life

1655
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,690
他们把你送到这里来生活

1656
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,690
that's exactly what they take.

1657
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,690
这就是他们确实想要做的

1658
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,490
Part that counts, anyway.

1659
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:27,490
无论怎样已经部分达到了

1660
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,990
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

1661
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,990
我不能再照顾你了 杰克

1662
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,790
You go on now.

1663
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:40,790
你走吧

1664
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,590
You're free.

1665
01:00:42,090 --> 01:00:43,590
你自由了

1666
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,390
You're free.

1667
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,390
你自由了

1668
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,090
Good luck, Brooksie.

1669
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,090
布鲁斯 祝你好运

1670
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,590
Dear fellas:

1671
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,590
大家好

1672
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:50,890
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

1673
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:50,890
外面的改变令我难以想像

1674
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:54,990
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

1675
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:54,990
老头 找死啊?

1676
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:59,790
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid

1677
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:59,790
我童年时只见过一次汽车

1678
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,790
but now they're everywhere.

1679
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,790
但现在到处都是

1680
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:10,790
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

1681
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:10,790
世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中

1682
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,390
The parole board got me into this halfway house

1683
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:30,390
假释委员会给我安排了中途宿舍

1684
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,390
called "The Brewer"

1685
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,390
叫做"酿酒人"

1686
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,690
and a job

1687
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,690
和一份工作

1688
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,890
bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

1689
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:36,890
在一家杂货店里包装食物

1690
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:40,890
It's hard work and I try to keep up

1691
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:40,890
虽然很辛苦 但我很努力工作

1692
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,390
but my hands hurt most of the time.

1693
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,390
我的手经常感到酸痛

1694
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,690
Make sure your man double-bags.

1695
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:45,690
记得用两层袋

1696
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,890
Last time, the bottom near came out.

1697
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,890
上次几乎穿底了

1698
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,590
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?

1699
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:51,590
听到那女士说的吗?

1700
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,090
Yes, sir. Surely will.

1701
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:53,090
是的 先生

1702
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:56,790
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

1703
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:56,790
我想那店主不太喜欢我

1704
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,190
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

1705
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:04,190
有时工作完后 我到公园里去喂那些鸽子

1706
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,090
I keep thinking

1707
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,090
我一直希望

1708
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,690
Jake might just show up and say hello.

1709
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:09,690
杰克会飞来和我打招呼

1710
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,290
But he never does.

1711
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,290
但它从未来过

1712
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:18,290
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

1713
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:18,290
我希望 不管在哪 它都过的很好 又交到新朋友

1714
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,690
I have trouble sleeping at night.

1715
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:24,690
晚上我不能入睡

1716
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,290
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

1717
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:28,290
经常作恶梦 身体像一直往下掉

1718
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,790
I wake up scared.

1719
01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,790
醒来时感到恐惧

1720
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,990
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

1721
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:34,990
要想一会儿才知道自己在哪儿

1722
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,590
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

1723
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:41,590
也许我该用枪打劫 让他们好送我回家

1724
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:46,190
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

1725
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:46,190
我可以打死那个店主 当作额外补助

1726
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:51,890
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

1727
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:51,890
但我已经太老了 再也干不了这种蠢事

1728
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,890
I don't like it here.

1729
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:53,890
我不喜欢这地方

1730
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:58,090
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided

1731
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:58,090
它令我感到害怕 我决定

1732
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,590
not to stay.

1733
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,590
离开

1734
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,090
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss

1735
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:14,090
我怀疑他们会争论

1736
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:17,790
not for an old crook like me.

1737
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:17,790
但不是为我这个老坏蛋

1738
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:08,890
"老布来此一游"

1739
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,490
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

1740
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,490
我怀疑他们会争论 但不是为我这种老坏蛋

1741
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,390
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

1742
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:29,390
另外 跟海伍德说 上次的事很对不起

1743
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,890
No hard feelings. Brooks."

1744
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,890
不再有痛苦的感觉了 布鲁斯

1745
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,390
He should have died in here.

1746
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,390
他应该死在这儿

1747
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,290
What the fuck have you done?

1748
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,290
你该死的做了什么?

1749
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,190
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

1750
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,190
一团糟 我来告诉你

1751
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:03,390
What's all this? You tell me. They're addressed to you.

1752
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:03,390
这些都是什么? 你告诉我 全都寄给你的

1753
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:05,990
Take it.

1754
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:05,990
拿着

1755
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,090
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

1756
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,090
亲爱的德弗瑞恩先生

1757
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,190
In response to your inquiries

1758
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,190
应你的来信请求 州政府拨给

1759
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,690
the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

1760
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:23,690
你的图书馆计划经费

1761
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,290
This is $ 200.

1762
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:26,290
这是200元

1763
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:30,490
"In addition, the library district has generously responded

1764
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:30,490
而州立图书馆

1765
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,190
with a donation of used books and sundries.

1766
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,190
捐出旧书和日常用品

1767
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,390
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

1768
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,390
这些应是你所需要的 而此事亦告一段落

1769
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,590
Please stop sending us letters."

1770
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,590
恳请阁下勿再来信

1771
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:42,490
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

1772
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:42,490
典狱长回来前要清理好

1773
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,890
Yes, sir.

1774
01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:43,890
知道

1775
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,290
Good for you, Andy.

1776
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,290
安迪 真不错

1777
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,390
Wow!

1778
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,390
哦!

1779
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,590
It only took six years.

1780
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:56,590
只用了六年时间

1781
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,890
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

1782
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,890
由现在起 我每星期写两封信

1783
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,390
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out

1784
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:04,390
你真的很疯狂 把这儿清理干净

1785
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:05,490
like he said.

1786
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:05,490
照他说的办

1787
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,090
I've got to pinch a loaf.

1788
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,090
我去厕所

1789
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,790
When I come back

1790
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,790
回来时

1791
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,690
this is all gone, all right?

1792
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,690
不想见到这些书

1793
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,390
莫扎特的中伯爵夫人
和苏珊娜的二重唱

1794
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,440
Sull'aria...

1795
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,440
∮ 大意 : 微风轻吹…

1796
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,190
Andy, Do you hear that?

1797
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,190
安迪 听到了吗?

1798
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,280
..zeffiretto

1799
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:04,280
∮ 希望能够吹起柔柔的西风…

1800
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:24,340
Questa sera spirerà

1801
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:24,340
∮ 西风…

1802
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:59,090
Sotto i pinis

1803
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:59,090
∮ 今晚会有风吧…

1804
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:04,340
Del boschetto

1805
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:04,340
∮ 今晚 …

1806
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,260
Sotto i pini...

1807
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,260
∮ 在林中松树的下面…

1808
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,790
Dufresne!

1809
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,790
德弗瑞恩!

1810
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,890
Andy, let me out!

1811
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:14,890
安迪 让我出去

1812
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:26,690
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

1813
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:26,690
我到今天也没不明白 这两个意大利女人在唱着什么

1814
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,190
Truth is, I don't want to know.

1815
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:29,190
事实上 我也不想去明白

1816
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,890
Some things are best left unsaid.

1817
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:31,890
有些东西不说更好

1818
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,190
I like to think it was something so beautiful

1819
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,190
我想那是 如此的美

1820
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,590
it can't be expressed in words

1821
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:40,590
无法用语言来形容

1822
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,690
and makes your heart ache because of it.

1823
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,690
美得让你心痛

1824
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,790
I tell you, those voices soared

1825
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,790
我告诉你 那声音飞翔

1826
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,390
higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

1827
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,390
比在这个灰暗地方的任何一个人梦想的都要高远

1828
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,990
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage

1829
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:55,990
像一只美丽的小鸟 飞进了我们这灰色的鸟笼

1830
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,890
and made those walls dissolve away.

1831
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,890
让这些围墙消失了

1832
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,590
And for the briefest of moments

1833
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:01,590
在那一刻

1834
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,790
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

1835
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:04,790
每个在肖申克的落伍者 感到了的自由

1836
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,990
It pissed the warden off something awful.

1837
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,990
但那令典狱长极度愤怒

1838
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,290
Open the door.

1839
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,290
开门

1840
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,990
Open it up!

1841
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:16,990
开门!

1842
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,990
Dufresne, open this door!

1843
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:20,990
德弗瑞恩 开门

1844
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,590
Turn that off!

1845
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,590
把它关掉!

1846
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,090
I am warning you. Turn that off!

1847
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,090
我警告你 德弗瑞恩!把它关掉

1848
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,390
You're mine now.

1849
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,390
你落到我手里了

1850
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,990
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

1851
01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:02,990
安迪被关禁闭两周

1852
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,790
On your feet.

1853
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:04,790
站起来

1854
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,390
- Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!

1855
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:08,390
- 看看谁回来了 - 大艺术家!

1856
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:13,790
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?

1857
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:13,790
你就不能放些好听的吗 嗯? 比如汉克.威廉姆斯!

1858
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,990
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

1859
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,990
还没来得及接受点播 他们就破门进来了

1860
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,290
- Was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.

1861
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,290
- 被关了两周 值得吗? - 那是我最好的时光

1862
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,490
No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week in the hole is like a year.

1863
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,490
没有被关小号容易过的事 那个地方一个星期就像一年

1864
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,190
Damn straight. I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

1865
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,190
对 我有莫扎特先生陪我

1866
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,390
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

1867
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,390
他们让你带留声机到那儿?

1868
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,190
It was in here.

1869
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,190
它就在这儿

1870
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,290
In here.

1871
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,290
在这儿

1872
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,490
That's the beauty of music. They

1873
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,490
这就是音乐的魅力 他们

1874
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,990
can't get that from you.

1875
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:42,990
不能把它从你这儿夺走

1876
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,990
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1877
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,990
你们从没此感觉吗?

1878
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,890
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

1879
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:53,890
我年轻时曾学过吹口琴

1880
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,290
Lost interest in it, though.

1881
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:56,290
可是 现在已经失去兴趣了

1882
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,190
Didn't make much sense in here.

1883
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,190
因为在这里没有任何意义

1884
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,590
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1885
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,590
这里才是它最有意义的地方

1886
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,090
You need it so you don't forget.

1887
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,090
你需要它就不会忘记它

1888
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,590
Forget?

1889
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:04,590
忘记?

1890
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,790
Forget that there are...

1891
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,790
忘记有一些...

1892
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,190
places

1893
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,190
地方

1894
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:14,590
in the world that aren't made out of stone.

1895
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:14,590
在这个世界上 不是用石头围成

1896
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,090
There's something

1897
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,090
有些东西

1898
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,090
inside

1899
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,090
在内心

1900
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,290
that they can't get to

1901
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:21,290
不能到达

1902
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,590
that they can't touch.

1903
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,590
不能触摸

1904
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,590
That's yours.

1905
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,590
属于你

1906
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,690
What are you talking about?

1907
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,690
你在说什么?

1908
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,990
Hope.

1909
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:29,990
希望

1910
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,390
Hope.

1911
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,390
希望

1912
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,290
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1913
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:36,290
我告诉你 我的朋友

1914
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,390
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1915
01:12:37,090 --> 01:12:39,390
希望是很危险的东西

1916
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,890
Hope can drive a man insane.

1917
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,890
希望会让人疯狂

1918
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,790
It's got no use on the inside.

1919
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,790
它在这儿没用

1920
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,190
You'd better get used to that idea.

1921
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:48,190
你最好习惯这想法

1922
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,190
Like Brooks did?

1923
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:52,190
就像布鲁斯?

1924
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,590
Sit down.

1925
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:18,590
坐下

1926
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,190
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

1927
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,190
你因终身监禁在此三十年

1928
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,390
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1929
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:30,390
觉得自己被改造了吗?

1930
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,890
Oh, yes, sir.

1931
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,890
是的 先生

1932
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,490
Without a doubt.

1933
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:34,490
毫无疑问

1934
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:38,090
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1935
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:38,090
老实说我己改过

1936
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,990
No danger to society here.

1937
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,990
我已不会危害社会

1938
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,090
God's honest truth.

1939
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,090
上帝可以作证

1940
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,690
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1941
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,690
真的改变了

1942
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:54,190
"不合格"

1943
01:13:58,690 --> 01:13:59,990
Thirty years.

1944
01:13:58,690 --> 01:13:59,990
三十年

1945
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,890
Jesus, when you say it like that

1946
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,890
当你这样说时

1947
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,590
You wonder where it went.

1948
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,590
想过是怎样过的吗?

1949
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,190
I wonder where 10 years went.

1950
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,190
我在想十年是怎样过去的

1951
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,190
Here.

1952
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,190
这儿

1953
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,390
A little parole rejection present.

1954
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,390
这是庆祝你假释被拒绝的礼物

1955
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,290
Go ahead and open it.

1956
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,290
打来看看吧

1957
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,490
Went through one of your competitors.

1958
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,490
跟你的竞争对手买的

1959
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,790
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.

1960
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,790
别介意 我想让它给你一个惊喜

1961
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:41,290
It's very pretty.

1962
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:41,290
它真漂亮

1963
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,290
Thank you.

1964
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,290
谢谢你

1965
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,290
You going to play it?

1966
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,290
你会用它来吹奏吗?

1967
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,090
No.

1968
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,090
不

1969
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,090
Not right now.

1970
01:14:57,690 --> 01:14:59,090
不会是现在

1971
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:17,890
Roll in!

1972
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:17,890
关上!

1973
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:34,290
"这个新女孩给你纪念十周年 瑞德赠"

1974
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,390
Lights out!

1975
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,390
熄灯

1976
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:32,090
Andy was as good as his word.

1977
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:32,090
安迪说到做到

1978
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,190
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1979
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,190
他每周写两封信

1980
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:41,290
In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact

1981
01:16:37,290 --> 01:16:41,290
1959年 州议员最后终于面对现实

1982
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,790
they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.

1983
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:44,790
那200元的支票起不了作用

1984
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:49,290
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500

1985
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:49,290
最后通过每年拨款500元

1986
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,390
just to shut him up.

1987
01:16:49,490 --> 01:16:51,390
来让他闭嘴

1988
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,590
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

1989
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,590
随后安迪所说的令你感到更意外

1990
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,690
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1991
01:16:54,790 --> 01:16:57,690
他与书友俱乐部 慈善团体谈妥

1992
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,690
He bought remaindered books by the pound

1993
01:16:57,890 --> 01:17:00,690
他用剩下来的钱来买书

1994
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,690
Treasure Island.

1995
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:02,690
《金银岛》

1996
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,590
Robert Louis

1997
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:04,590
罗伯特·路易斯

1998
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,790
Stevenson.

1999
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:05,790
斯蒂文森

2000
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,390
Fiction, adventure.

2001
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:07,390
科幻类 冒险类

2002
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,990
What's next?

2003
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:10,990
下一本是什么?

2004
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:14,290
I got here Auto Repair

2005
01:17:11,190 --> 01:17:14,290
是汽车修理

2006
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,190
and Soap Carving.

2007
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:16,190
和肥皂雕刻技术

2008
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:19,590
Trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.

2009
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:19,590
技术与爱好 教育性那一栏

2010
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,690
Count of Monte Crisco.

2011
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,690
《基督山伯爵》

2012
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,490
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

2013
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,490
那书不值一看

2014
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,490
By Alexandree

2015
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:26,490
作者是亚历山大

2016
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,290
Dumas

2017
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,290
大仲马

2018
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,690
Dumb ass.

2019
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:29,690
"笨蛋"

2020
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,990
Dumb ass?

2021
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,990
"笨蛋"?

2022
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,890
Dumas. Know what that's about?

2023
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,890
大仲马 知道那是什么故事吗?

2024
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,090
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

2025
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,090
讲越狱的 你喜欢看的

2026
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,190
We ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

2027
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:46,190
那我觉得应该发到"教育类" 对吧?

2028
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:51,090
The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.

2029
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:51,090
我们其余的随时尽可能帮忙

2030
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,490
By the year Kennedy was shot

2031
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:53,490
到了肯尼迪遇刺那一年

2032
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:58,290
Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine

2033
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:58,290
安迪把一个充满松脂味的储藏间

2034
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:57,000
布鲁斯·哈特伦纪念图书馆

2035
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,690
into the best prison library in New England

2036
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,690
变成了新英格兰州最好的的监狱图书馆

2037
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,090
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

2038
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,090
那里有最好的汉克威廉姆斯唱片集

2039
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,350
Lord, I don't know what I'll do...

2040
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,350
∮ 我真是不知所措

2041
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,180
All I do is sit and sigh...

2042
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,180
∮ 每天除了傻傻地呆坐和叹气

2043
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,590
That was also when Warden Norton

2044
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,590
那也是诺顿典狱长发展大计的一年

2045
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,790
instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.

2046
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,790
推广他著名的"内在改造"计划

2047
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,290
You may remember reading about it.

2048
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:20,290
你可能从报纸上读到过

2049
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:23,590
It made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.

2050
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:23,590
所有的媒体都刊出他的照片

2051
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,090
It's no free ride

2052
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,090
这不是放任的方式

2053
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,590
but rather a genuine progressive advance

2054
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:28,590
而是一种真正的进步

2055
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,290
in corrections and rehabilitation.

2056
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:31,290
让犯人恢复道德

2057
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,090
Our inmates, properly supervised

2058
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:34,090
收容人被适当的监督

2059
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,990
will be put to work outside these walls

2060
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,990
使他们能在外面工作

2061
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,490
performing all manner of public service.

2062
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,490
为大众服务

2063
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,990
These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor

2064
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:42,990
他们会懂得劳动的价值

2065
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,990
and provide a service to the community

2066
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:46,990
为社会服务的诚实劳动

2067
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:52,190
at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

2068
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:52,190
在最低耗支情况下 来利用纳税人的金钱

2069
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,890
Of course he didn't tell the press

2070
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:54,890
当然 诺顿没有跟报界说

2071
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:58,590
that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.

2072
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:58,590
"最低耗支"其实是相当不确切的说法

2073
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:01,790
There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.

2074
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:01,790
有很多办法能瞒天过海的

2075
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,490
Men, materials, you name it.

2076
01:19:02,090 --> 01:19:04,490
人力 物力 你说多少就多少

2077
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:07,790
And oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!

2078
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:07,790
上帝 钱是这样滚入!

2079
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:10,490
At this rate, you'll put me out of business.

2080
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:10,490
继续这样 我不用干了

2081
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:15,190
With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.

2082
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:15,190
有这些劳工 你可比这镇上的承包商出更低价

2083
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,690
We're providing a valuable community service.

2084
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:18,690
我们提供有用的社区劳务

2085
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,590
That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

2086
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:22,590
对报界来说很动听 但我要养家活口的

2087
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,790
We go back a long way.

2088
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:26,790
我们走得太远

2089
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,990
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

2090
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,990
我需要这份公路的合同 如果拿不到我就完了

2091
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,690
You have some of this fine pie my missus made for you.

2092
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,690
尝尝我的妻子给你特制的陷饼吧

2093
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,290
You think about that.

2094
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,290
好好考虑一下

2095
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,290
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

2096
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:50,290
如果我是你对此合同并不担心

2097
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,590
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

2098
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:53,590
我已把人手派至别处

2099
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,590
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

2100
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,590
谢谢你太太的糕饼

2101
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,890
And behind every shady deal

2102
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:01,890
每笔暗盘交易下

2103
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:04,790
behind every dollar earned

2104
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:04,790
赚来的每一分钱

2105
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,190
there was Andy, keeping the books.

2106
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,190
都是由安迪来作记录的

2107
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:09,790
Two deposits.

2108
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:09,790
两笔存款

2109
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:14,090
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.

2110
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:14,090
文尼国际和新格兰 一天又过去了

2111
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,900
Get my stuff to the laundry.

2112
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,900
把我的东西拿到洗衣房

2113
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,790
Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

2114
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,790
把两套衣服要干洗的 还有一袋这样的

2115
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:52,790
If they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.

2116
01:20:49,190 --> 01:20:52,790
如果他们再把我的衬衫浆过了头 有他们好受的

2117
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,290
How do I look?

2118
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,290
我看上去怎么样?

2119
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,790
- Very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way.

2120
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:57,790
- 很不错 - 这是盛大的慈善晚会

2121
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,590
Governor will be there.

2122
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,590
州长也会出席

2123
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,390
You want the rest of this?

2124
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,390
你要剩下的这些吗?

2125
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:05,690
Woman can't bake worth shit.

2126
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:05,690
烤的太难吃

2127
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:08,290
Thank you, sir.

2128
01:21:06,890 --> 01:21:08,290
谢谢 长官

2129
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:14,290
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

2130
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:14,290
我听说这样的派 他收了不少

2131
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:19,390
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

2132
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:19,390
他有你想象不到的手段 回扣、酬金..

2133
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,990
A river of dirty money running through here.

2134
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:21,990
黑钱像河一样流过这里

2135
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,990
Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

2136
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:25,990
但他迟早得解释钱是从何而来的

2137
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,990
That's where I come in.

2138
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,990
这就是我牵涉其中的原因

2139
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,890
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

2140
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,890
我安排了一切来过滤

2141
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,890
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

2142
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,890
股票、债券、市政免税

2143
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:37,790
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back

2144
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:37,790
我把钱送到外面 等它们回来的时候

2145
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:40,890
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.

2146
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:40,890
- 纯洁得就像个处女 - 像洗衣机

2147
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,090
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

2148
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,090
到诺顿退休的时候 我已让他成为百万富翁了

2149
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,290
If they ever catch on,

2150
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,290
如果被他们抓住的话

2151
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:51,290
he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.

2152
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:51,290
他将在自己的监狱穿上这样的号码服

2153
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,790
I thought you had more faith in me than that.

2154
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:54,790
看来你对我没有信心

2155
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,990
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.

2156
01:21:54,990 --> 01:21:57,990
我知道你很能干 但是总会蛛丝马迹留下

2157
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:01,590
Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS

2158
01:21:58,190 --> 01:22:01,590
只要有人想细查 FBI 国税局

2159
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,790
whatever...

2160
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:02,790
不管怎样...

2161
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,590
It'll lead to somebody.

2162
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,590
总会有人被牵扯

2163
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:08,590
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.

2164
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:08,590
是的 但不会是我 也不会是典狱长

2165
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:13,990
All right, who?

2166
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:13,990
那会是谁?

2167
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,790
Randall Stevens.

2168
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,790
兰度·史蒂文

2169
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:17,290
Who?

2170
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:17,290
谁?

2171
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,490
The "silent" silent partner.

2172
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:19,490
从不出声的拍档

2173
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:22,690
He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.

2174
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:22,690
他是帐户的持有者 他才有罪

2175
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:25,090
It's where the filtering process starts.

2176
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:25,090
他那里是过滤黑钱过程的起点

2177
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:28,190
They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.

2178
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:28,190
不管他们如何调查 都只会查到他

2179
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:29,990
But who is he?

2180
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:29,990
他是什么人?

2181
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:34,190
He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

2182
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:34,190
他是一个幻影 幽灵 是兔子哈维的第二个表弟

2183
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:36,490
I conjured him...

2184
01:22:35,290 --> 01:22:36,490
我凭空...

2185
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,990
out of thin air.

2186
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:37,990
造出他来

2187
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,590
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

2188
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:41,590
他只存在于文件中罢了

2189
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,990
You can't just make a person up.

2190
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,990
你不能只这么捏造一个人

2191
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:50,290
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

2192
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:50,290
当然可以 如果你知道我们社会系统的漏洞

2193
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:53,590
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

2194
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:53,590
吃惊的是邮政就能帮你做到

2195
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,590
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate

2196
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,590
史蒂文先生有出生证明书

2197
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,890
driver's license, Social Security.

2198
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:58,890
驾驶执照和社会编号

2199
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:00,190
You're shitting me.

2200
01:22:59,190 --> 01:23:00,190
你在说笑

2201
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,790
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing

2202
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,790
他们追查帐户的话 只是在追查

2203
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:05,690
a figment of my imagination.

2204
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:05,690
我幻想出来的人

2205
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,890
Well, I'll be damned!

2206
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,890
喔 该死

2207
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,990
Did I say you were good?

2208
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:10,990
我没说过你很能干吗?

2209
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,990
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

2210
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,990
该死 你简直是伦勃朗

2211
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,490
The funny thing is

2212
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,490
有趣的是

2213
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,690
on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

2214
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:19,690
在外面 我是个诚实的人 正直得像杆直箭

2215
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,490
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

2216
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,490
变成骗子就不得不到监狱里来

2217
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,690
Ever bother you?

2218
01:23:31,390 --> 01:23:32,690
你担心过吗?

2219
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,190
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.

2220
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,190
我没参与 我只是处理收益

2221
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,490
A fine line, maybe

2222
01:23:37,490 --> 01:23:39,490
一条好的分界线 也许吧

2223
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,090
but I also built that library

2224
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:42,090
不过我也建起了图书馆

2225
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:45,290
and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

2226
01:23:42,290 --> 01:23:45,290
来帮助囚犯取得高中文凭

2227
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,790
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

2228
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,790
你可知他会何会让我做所有这些?

2229
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,190
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

2230
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,190
让你开心 好帮他"清洗"

2231
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,790
Money instead of sheets.

2232
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,790
洗的是钱而非床单

2233
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,790
Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.

2234
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,790
让我工作轻松 那是交易

2235
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,690
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965

2236
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:14,690
汤姆·威廉姆斯1965年到肖申克监狱服刑

2237
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,190
on a two-year stretch for B and E.

2238
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,190
因非法入室行窃 被判两年监禁

2239
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,690
That's breaking and entering to you.

2240
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:19,690
那是对私人的非法入侵

2241
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,990
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

2242
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:23,990
警察在佩妮家后门抓到 他在电视旁鬼鬼祟祟的

2243
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:25,990
Young punk.

2244
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:25,990
年轻的朋克

2245
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:27,790
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll

2246
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:27,790
"摇滚"先生

2247
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,490
cocky as hell.

2248
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,490
过于自大

2249
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,090
Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!

2250
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,090
快点 老家伙们 慢得跟糖浆一样

2251
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:34,090
Making me look bad.

2252
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:34,090
我干着急

2253
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,090
We liked him immediately.

2254
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,090
我们马上就喜欢上他了

2255
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:40,090
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

2256
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:40,090
我从后门出来 像这样捧着电视机

2257
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:44,090
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.

2258
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:44,090
一件大的老家伙 我都看不到了 然后我听到...

2259
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:46,690
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

2260
01:24:44,690 --> 01:24:46,690
别动 举起手来!

2261
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:51,490
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:

2262
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:51,490
我站在那里 捧着电视机 他又说:

2263
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:55,490
"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.

2264
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:55,490
"你听到我说的吗?" 我说 "是的 先生"

2265
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,890
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."

2266
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:59,890
但我掉落东西 你会告我毁坏他人财物

2267
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,290
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

2268
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,290
你曾在卡士文服刑 是吗?

2269
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:10,290
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

2270
01:25:06,290 --> 01:25:10,290
是的 那儿要好过得多

2271
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,290
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

2272
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:13,290
周末有休假 工作也很有计划

2273
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:14,790
Sounds like you done time all over.

2274
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:14,790
不像这里 看来你在新英格兰都呆在车里

2275
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,390
I've been in and out since I was 13.

2276
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:19,390
我十三岁出道 哪里都去过

2277
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,790
Name it, chances are I've been there.

2278
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,790
说说看 也许我也去过那里

2279
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,490
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

2280
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,490
也许你应转行了

2281
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,490
What I mean is

2282
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,490
我是说

2283
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:31,190
you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.

2284
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:31,190
你不是个一流的小偷 你该试试别的

2285
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:34,690
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?

2286
01:25:31,490 --> 01:25:34,690
是吗?你以为你懂这个?

2287
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,690
What are you in for?

2288
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,690
你怎会进来的?

2289
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,990
Me?

2290
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:37,990
我吗?

2291
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:42,090
A lawyer fucked me.

2292
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:42,090
律师坑了我

2293
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:48,990
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

2294
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:48,990
这儿所有人都是无辜的 你不知道吗?

2295
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:01,290
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

2296
01:25:56,890 --> 01:26:01,290
后来知道 汤姆竟然有妻子和刚出生的女儿

2297
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,990
Maybe he thought of them on the streets

2298
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:03,990
也许他想到她们在街上流荡

2299
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,690
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

2300
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,690
孩子长大却不知道父亲是谁

2301
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,290
Whatever it was

2302
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:08,290
不管为什么 总之

2303
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:11,090
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

2304
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:11,090
他竟努力起来了

2305
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:17,790
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

2306
01:26:14,990 --> 01:26:17,790
我想考取高校文凭

2307
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:20,490
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

2308
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:20,490
听说你已经帮了很多人了

2309
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,090
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

2310
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:24,090
我不会在失败者身上浪费时间的

2311
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,990
I ain't no goddamn loser.

2312
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,990
我再也不是失败者了

2313
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,590
- You mean that? - Yeah.

2314
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:31,590
- 你当真? - 是

2315
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:34,690
You really mean that?

2316
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:34,690
你真的是认真的?

2317
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,090
Yes, sir, I do.

2318
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,090
是的 先生 绝对是真的

2319
01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:39,290
Good. Because if we do this

2320
01:26:37,290 --> 01:26:39,290
好 因为我们要做就要

2321
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:43,390
we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

2322
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:43,390
有始有终 绝对不能半途而废

2323
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,490
Thing is, see

2324
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:45,490
问题是

2325
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,290
I don't read so good.

2326
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:48,290
我识字不多

2327
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,490
"Well."

2328
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,490
好吧

2329
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:54,290
You don't read

2330
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:54,290
你不识字

2331
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,990
so well.

2332
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:55,990
就这样

2333
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,890
We'll get to that.

2334
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,890
我们就由它开始

2335
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,490
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

2336
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:06,490
就这样 安迪开始给汤姆上课

2337
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,290
Started walking him through his ABC's.

2338
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:09,290
从最基础的字母开始教

2339
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,590
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

2340
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:13,590
汤姆学得很快

2341
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:16,690
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

2342
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:16,690
从不知道自己的聪明

2343
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:22,490
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

2344
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:22,490
没过多久 安迪开始教他课程内容

2345
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,290
He really liked the kid.

2346
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:24,290
他很喜欢这个孩子

2347
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:28,090
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

2348
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:28,090
帮一个孩子上进让他很快乐

2349
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,890
But that wasn't the only reason.

2350
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:30,890
但那不是唯一的原因

2351
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,790
Prison time is slow time.

2352
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:33,790
监狱里的日子很缓慢

2353
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,790
So you do what you can to keep going.

2354
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:36,790
要用某些事情来消磨时间

2355
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:39,190
Some fellas collect stamps.

2356
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:39,190
有人收集邮票

2357
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,090
Others build matchstick houses.

2358
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,090
有人收集火柴盒

2359
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,390
Andy built a library.

2360
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:45,390
安迪建起了图书馆

2361
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,790
Now he needed a new project.

2362
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,790
现在他需要新的计划

2363
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,190
Tommy was it.

2364
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:50,190
那就是汤姆

2365
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:54,790
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

2366
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:54,790
那和他多年来雕磨石头的原因一样

2367
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:58,590
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

2368
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:58,590
也如同他把美女的画像挂在墙上的原因

2369
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:00,790
In prison

2370
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:00,790
在监狱里

2371
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:04,790
a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

2372
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:04,790
一个人不能让心里空着

2373
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:10,390
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams

2374
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:10,390
在1966年 汤姆刚要参加考试的时候

2375
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,790
it was lovely Raquel.

2376
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:12,790
可爱的瑞奎尔出现了

2377
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,390
Time.

2378
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,390
时间到

2379
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,390
Well?

2380
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,390
好了吗?

2381
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:41,190
Well, it's for shit.

2382
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:41,190
真的是一团糟

2383
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,490
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

2384
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,490
我白花了一年时间在这狗屎上面

2385
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,190
It's probably not that bad.

2386
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,190
也许没有你想的那么糟

2387
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:50,390
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.

2388
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:50,390
比我想像中的还要糟 就像在考中文

2389
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,590
Let's see how the score comes out.

2390
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:52,590
看看你得了多少分?

2391
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,690
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

2392
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,690
我来告诉你吧

2393
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,990
Two points, right there!

2394
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,990
两分

2395
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,790
There's your goddamn score!

2396
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:00,790
那就是你该死的考试

2397
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:04,690
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25

2398
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:04,690
什么猫爬上树 5乘以5是25

2399
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,290
Fuck this place!

2400
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:07,290
去死吧

2401
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,690
Fuck it!

2402
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:08,690
他妈的

2403
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:29,090
I feel bad.

2404
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:29,090
我感觉很差

2405
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:30,490
I let him down.

2406
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:30,490
我令他失望了

2407
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,390
That's crap, kid.

2408
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,390
不是这样 孩子

2409
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:33,990
He's proud of you.

2410
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:33,990
他以你为荣

2411
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,190
We're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.

2412
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:37,190
我跟他是老朋友 我很清楚他的性格

2413
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,890
Smart fellow, ain't he?

2414
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,890
聪明的伙伴 不是吗?

2415
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:42,290
Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.

2416
01:29:39,190 --> 01:29:42,290
就像刚进来时一样聪明 他以前是个银行家

2417
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,690
What's he in here for anyway?

2418
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,690
他为什么被抓进来?

2419
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:45,990
Murder.

2420
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:45,990
谋杀

2421
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,890
The hell, you say.

2422
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:48,890
你说什么?

2423
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:53,290
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

2424
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:53,290
人不可以貌相

2425
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,290
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro

2426
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,290
在床上捉到妻子和一个高尔夫选手

2427
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,590
Greased them both.

2428
01:29:57,300 --> 01:29:58,590
把他们两个一起解决了

2429
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,690
What?

2430
01:30:06,690 --> 01:30:07,690
怎么了?

2431
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:11,590
About four years ago

2432
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:11,590
大约四年前

2433
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:15,090
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

2434
01:30:11,890 --> 01:30:15,090
我在汤玛斯狱服刑

2435
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,290
I stole a car.

2436
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:17,290
我偷了一辆车

2437
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,790
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

2438
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:19,790
这是很不应该的事

2439
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,190
About six months left to go

2440
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,190
在出狱前六个月

2441
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,390
I get a new cellmate in.

2442
01:30:22,490 --> 01:30:24,390
我有了个新同房

2443
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,690
Elmo Blatch.

2444
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:26,690
艾马·布莱奇

2445
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,690
Big, twitchy fucker.

2446
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,690
一个强壮、暴躁的混蛋

2447
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,090
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

2448
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,090
人见人憎的那种 明白我的意思吗?

2449
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:35,990
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

2450
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:35,990
刑期是六到十二年 持械抢劫

2451
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:38,590
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

2452
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:38,590
他说自己犯了不少案子

2453
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,690
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

2454
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,690
难以相信 他很容易激动

2455
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,690
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

2456
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,690
你放个屁 他就暴跳如雷

2457
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:49,390
Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

2458
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:49,390
整天说个不停 从不闭嘴

2459
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,290
Places he'd been in

2460
01:30:49,590 --> 01:30:51,290
他谈他去过的地方

2461
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:54,590
jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

2462
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:54,590
他干过的案子 上过的女人

2463
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:57,090
Even people he killed.

2464
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:57,090
和他杀的人

2465
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:01,090
People who "gave him shit."

2466
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:01,090
那些让他不爽的人

2467
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,290
That's how he put it.

2468
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:03,290
他是这么说的

2469
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:07,990
So one night, like a joke

2470
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:07,990
有天晚上 我开玩笑的说

2471
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,590
I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"

2472
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,590
我问他 艾马 你杀了谁?

2473
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:13,890
So he says:

2474
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:13,890
他说

2475
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:18,090
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club

2476
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:18,090
有次我在乡村俱乐部打工

2477
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:22,690
so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

2478
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:22,690
看到来的人都非富则贵

2479
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,790
So I pick out this guy

2480
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,790
所以我选了一个家伙

2481
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,190
go in one night

2482
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,190
有天晚上到他家里去

2483
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:31,190
and do his place.

2484
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:31,190
抢劫东西

2485
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:33,890
He wakes up

2486
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:33,890
他醒过来

2487
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,390
and gives me shit.

2488
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:36,390
令我很不爽

2489
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,190
So I killed him.

2490
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:39,190
所以我杀了他

2491
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,790
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

2492
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,790
他和他的情妇

2493
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,390
And that's the best part.

2494
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:47,390
那是最精彩的部分

2495
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,590
She's fucking this prick, see

2496
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,590
她在和这个职业高尔夫球手做爱

2497
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:53,790
this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.

2498
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:53,790
但她是个有夫之妇

2499
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,990
Some hotshot banker.

2500
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:56,990
她丈夫是个银行家

2501
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:00,990
And he's the one they pinned it on.

2502
01:31:58,490 --> 01:32:00,990
而他竟成了替罪羊

2503
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:16,290
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

2504
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:16,290
这是我听过的最震惊的故事

2505
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,090
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

2506
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:20,090
更让我吃惊的是 你竟然相信了它

2507
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:21,790
Sir?

2508
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:21,790
先生?

2509
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,590
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

2510
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:27,590
很明显威廉姆斯很喜欢你

2511
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:32,190
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

2512
01:32:28,190 --> 01:32:32,190
他知道你的事后想让你振作起来

2513
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:34,490
He's young, not terribly bright.

2514
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:34,490
他还年轻 不怎么明事理

2515
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,490
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

2516
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,490
他根本不明白这对你意味着什么 这并不奇怪

2517
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,490
Sir, he's telling the truth.

2518
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:40,490
狱长 他讲的是事实

2519
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:45,190
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

2520
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:45,190
就说这个 如果有布莱奇这个人的话

2521
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:50,290
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.

2522
01:32:45,690 --> 01:32:50,290
你认为他会跪下来 哭着说"是我做的 我坦白"

2523
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:53,190
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

2524
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:53,190
方便的话 给我加个终身监禁吧

2525
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:56,190
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

2526
01:32:53,390 --> 01:32:56,190
但是汤姆的证供能让我的案子重审

2527
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,890
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

2528
01:32:56,390 --> 01:32:58,890
前提是布莱奇在那狱中

2529
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,090
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

2530
01:32:59,090 --> 01:33:01,090
也许他现在已经获释了

2531
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,690
They'd have his last known address.

2532
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,690
他们应该有他的住址的

2533
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:05,890
It's a chance, isn't it?

2534
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:05,890
这是个机会 对吗?

2535
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,890
How can you be so obtuse?

2536
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:09,890
你怎会这么愚蠢?

2537
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:11,890
What?

2538
01:33:10,890 --> 01:33:11,890
什么?

2539
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,790
What did you call me?

2540
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:14,790
你说什么?

2541
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,790
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

2542
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,790
愚蠢 这是故意说的?

2543
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:18,590
You're forgetting yourself.

2544
01:33:17,090 --> 01:33:18,590
你忘记你自己的身份了

2545
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,890
The country club will have his old timecards.

2546
01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:21,890
俱乐部会有他的工作记录卡的记录

2547
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,890
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

2548
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:24,890
和有他名字的报税表

2549
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,790
If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.

2550
01:33:25,090 --> 01:33:27,790
你要继续幻想的话 那是你的事

2551
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:30,590
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

2552
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:30,590
不要影响我 谈话结束

2553
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,390
If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.

2554
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:33,390
如果我能出去 我不会提起这里发生的一切

2555
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:36,990
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

2556
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:36,990
我可以继续为你洗黑钱

2557
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,790
Don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!

2558
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,790
永远不许和我提钱的事 你这个婊子养的

2559
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,690
Not in this office

2560
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:43,690
不许在这间办公室

2561
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:45,790
not anywhere. Get in here, now!

2562
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:45,790
不许在任何地方

2563
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:49,090
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.

2564
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:49,090
进来
我只是想让你放心 没别的意恩

2565
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,590
Solitary. A month.

2566
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,590
禁闭室 一个月 是 长官

2567
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,890
What's wrong with you?

2568
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,890
你怎么了?

2569
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,390
Get him out of here.

2570
01:33:53,090 --> 01:33:54,390
把他带出去

2571
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,190
This is my chance to get out!

2572
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,190
这是我出去的唯一的机会

2573
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,190
It's my life! Understand?!

2574
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:58,190
这是我的人生!你明白吗?

2575
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:00,490
Get him out!

2576
01:33:58,390 --> 01:34:00,490
带他出去!带他出去!

2577
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,190
A month in the hole.

2578
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,190
关禁闭一个月

2579
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:07,090
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

2580
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:07,090
这是我听到过的最严厉的惩罚

2581
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,590
It's all my fault.

2582
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:08,590
这都是我的错

2583
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:10,390
Bullshit.

2584
01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:10,390
废话

2585
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,790
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

2586
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:13,790
事情不是由你而起的 或让他入罪

2587
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:16,390
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

2588
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:16,390
你是说安迪是清白的?

2589
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,590
I mean, for real innocent?

2590
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:18,590
我是说 真真正正的无辜的?

2591
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:20,190
It looks that way.

2592
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:20,190
看起来是

2593
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,490
Sweet Jesus.

2594
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:22,490
天啊

2595
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,590
How long has he been here now?

2596
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,590
他到这里有多久了?

2597
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,290
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

2598
01:34:24,990 --> 01:34:28,290
1947 那是多少 19年

2599
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:31,090
Williams, Thomas. Yeah, over here.

2600
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:31,090
汤姆·威廉姆斯 是 在这

2601
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,090
What you got?

2602
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:38,090
这是什么?

2603
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:40,090
Board of Education.

2604
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:40,090
校董会来的信

2605
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:41,790
That son of a bitch mailed it.

2606
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:41,790
他竟把它寄出去了

2607
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:45,990
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

2608
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:45,990
你会打开它吗?还是打自己的屁股?

2609
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,390
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

2610
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:48,390
打自己的屁股听起来好一点

2611
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:51,690
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.

2612
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:51,690
把它还给我 你他妈的

2613
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:53,890
Floyd, come on.

2614
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:53,890
别这样

2615
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:01,690
Will you throw that away, please?

2616
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:01,690
请你扔掉它 好吗?

2617
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,990
Well, shit.

2618
01:35:07,290 --> 01:35:08,990
他妈的

2619
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:24,490
The kid passed. C + average.

2620
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:24,490
那孩子通过了 平均C+

2621
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,790
Thought you'd like to know.

2622
01:35:24,690 --> 01:35:26,790
我想你会喜欢的

2623
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,490
Warden wants to talk.

2624
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:44,490
典狱长要见你

2625
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:59,290
Out here?

2626
01:35:58,290 --> 01:35:59,290
就在这里?

2627
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:01,790
That's what the man said.

2628
01:35:59,490 --> 01:36:01,790
他是这么说的

2629
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,890
Warden?

2630
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:18,890
典狱长?

2631
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:32,890
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

2632
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:32,890
汤姆 我要你保证这次谈话只有我们两个知道

2633
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,690
I feel awkward enough as it is.

2634
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,690
我感到很艰难

2635
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,290
We got a situation here.

2636
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:57,290
这事的情形很特别

2637
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,190
I think you can appreciate that.

2638
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,190
我想你可以体会到

2639
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,690
Yes, sir.

2640
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:01,690
是的

2641
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,290
I sure can.

2642
01:37:01,890 --> 01:37:03,290
我肯定

2643
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,590
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

2644
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:07,590
告诉你 孩子 这件事让我承受很大压力

2645
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,690
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

2646
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:11,690
让我半夜惊醒 真的

2647
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:15,790
The right thing to do

2648
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:15,790
应该怎么做

2649
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:21,190
sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

2650
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:21,190
有时很难让人明白

2651
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,590
Do you understand?

2652
01:37:22,190 --> 01:37:23,590
你明白了吗?

2653
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:27,490
I need your help, son.

2654
01:37:25,890 --> 01:37:27,490
我需要你的帮助 孩子

2655
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,090
If I'm going to move on this

2656
01:37:28,990 --> 01:37:31,090
如果我要继续追查下去

2657
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,590
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

2658
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:34,590
就不能有丝毫的疑点

2659
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,390
I have to know

2660
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:36,390
我必须知道

2661
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:39,290
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

2662
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:39,290
你跟德弗瑞恩说的是事实吗?

2663
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:41,990
Absolutely.

2664
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:41,990
千真万确

2665
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,490
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury

2666
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:45,490
那么你能在法官和陪审团面前

2667
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:47,690
with your hand on the Good Book

2668
01:37:45,690 --> 01:37:47,690
手放在圣经上

2669
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:50,590
and take an oath before Almighty God himself?

2670
01:37:47,890 --> 01:37:50,590
向上帝发誓吗?

2671
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:52,590
Just give me that chance.

2672
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:52,590
只要你给我这个机会

2673
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:58,190
That's what I thought.

2674
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:58,190
那也正是我认为的

2675
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:47,190
I'm sure by now you've heard.

2676
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:47,190
我想你已经听说

2677
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:49,990
Terrible thing.

2678
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:49,990
那个坏消息了

2679
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:53,090
A man that young

2680
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:53,090
一个这么年青的人

2681
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,990
less than a year to go, trying to escape.

2682
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:55,990
还有一年就要出狱了 还想逃狱

2683
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:58,990
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

2684
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:58,990
哈德利队长被迫开枪

2685
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,290
Truly, it did.

2686
01:38:59,790 --> 01:39:01,290
那是事实

2687
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:06,690
We just have to put it behind us.

2688
01:39:04,290 --> 01:39:06,690
我们不要再去提那件事了

2689
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:09,590
Move on.

2690
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:09,590
继续生活

2691
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,690
I'm done.

2692
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:12,690
我已经完了

2693
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,690
Everything stops.

2694
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,690
一切己结束了

2695
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,990
Get someone else to run your scams.

2696
01:39:17,590 --> 01:39:19,990
找其他人帮你做吧

2697
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:23,090
Nothing stops.

2698
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:23,090
任何事都没停下来

2699
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,590
Nothing.

2700
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:25,590
任何事

2701
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:32,090
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

2702
01:39:28,990 --> 01:39:32,090
否则你在此继续熬下去

2703
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,790
No more protection from the guards.

2704
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,790
再也没有警卫保护你

2705
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:39,890
I'll pull you out of that 1-bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

2706
01:39:34,990 --> 01:39:39,890
我会把你从单人牢房转到同性恋者那里

2707
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,790
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

2708
01:39:41,290 --> 01:39:43,790
你会觉得你被火车操了

2709
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,690
And the library?

2710
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,690
至于图书馆?

2711
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:48,290
Gone.

2712
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:48,290
不存在了

2713
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:51,290
Sealed off, brick by brick.

2714
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:51,290
我们用书在院子里烤肉

2715
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:54,090
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

2716
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:54,090
会被一块块的砖头封闭起来

2717
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:56,390
They'll see the flames for miles.

2718
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:56,390
几英里以外都能看见火焰

2719
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,990
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

2720
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,990
我们像土著人那样围着书跳舞

2721
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:04,290
You understand me? Catching my drift?

2722
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:04,290
你明白我的意思了吗?听懂了吗?

2723
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,890
Or am I being obtuse?

2724
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:09,890
或许我很愚蠢?

2725
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,290
Give him another month to think about it.

2726
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:24,290
再给他一个月时间考虑清楚

2727
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:14,090
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

2728
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:14,090
我妻子曾说过我是个很难理解的人

2729
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,690
Like a closed book.

2730
01:41:14,890 --> 01:41:16,690
像本合着的书

2731
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,590
Complained about it all the time.

2732
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:19,590
她经常这样抱怨

2733
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,090
She was beautiful.

2734
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:22,090
她很漂亮

2735
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:25,990
God, I loved her.

2736
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:25,990
上帝 我爱她

2737
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,990
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

2738
01:41:29,690 --> 01:41:31,990
只是我不知道如何表达我的感情

2739
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:36,390
I killed her, Red.

2740
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:36,390
我杀了她 瑞德

2741
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:39,990
I didn't pull the trigger

2742
01:41:38,190 --> 01:41:39,990
虽然不是我开的枪

2743
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:43,190
but I drove her away.

2744
01:41:41,490 --> 01:41:43,190
但是我把她赶走的

2745
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:47,390
That's why she died, because of me

2746
01:41:44,690 --> 01:41:47,390
她是因我而死的

2747
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:48,990
the way I am.

2748
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:48,990
因为我对她的态度

2749
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,790
That don't make you a murderer.

2750
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:59,790
那不能判你谋杀的

2751
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,990
Bad husband, maybe.

2752
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:04,990
只能说是坏丈夫

2753
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,890
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

2754
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,890
你可以为此难过 但枪不是你开的

2755
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:13,390
No, I didn't.

2756
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:13,390
不是我杀的

2757
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,690
Somebody else did.

2758
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:15,690
是别人干的

2759
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,090
And I wound up in here.

2760
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:19,090
我在这里做了替死鬼

2761
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:23,090
Bad luck, I guess.

2762
01:42:21,590 --> 01:42:23,090
运气不好 我想

2763
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,790
It floats around.

2764
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:29,790
霉运到处漂浮

2765
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:33,090
It's got to land on somebody.

2766
01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:33,090
总要有人承受的

2767
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:35,890
It was my turn, that's all.

2768
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:35,890
刚巧轮到我罢了

2769
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:39,290
I was in the path of the tornado.

2770
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:39,290
我刚好碰上了它

2771
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:49,190
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

2772
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:49,190
我只是没有想到会这么久

2773
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:55,290
Think you'll ever get out of here?

2774
01:42:53,590 --> 01:42:55,290
想过你有一天能出去吗?

2775
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:57,490
Me?

2776
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:57,490
我?

2777
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:01,490
Yeah.

2778
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:01,490
有

2779
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:05,190
One day, when I got a long, white beard

2780
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:05,190
有一天 到我头发花白

2781
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:08,490
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.

2782
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:08,490
头昏眼花的时候

2783
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,190
I tell you where I'd go.

2784
01:43:10,590 --> 01:43:12,190
我告诉你 我会到哪里去

2785
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:15,290
Zihuatanejo.

2786
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:15,290
圣哈塔尼奥

2787
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,390
Say what?

2788
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,390
什么?

2789
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,490
Zihuatanejo.

2790
01:43:17,690 --> 01:43:19,490
圣哈塔尼奥

2791
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:22,090
It's in Mexico.

2792
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:22,090
在墨西哥

2793
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,590
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

2794
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,590
太平洋中的一个小地方

2795
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:29,590
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?

2796
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:29,590
你知道墨西哥人怎么形容太平洋的

2797
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:33,390
They say it has no memory.

2798
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:33,390
他们说那里是没有记忆的地方

2799
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:37,990
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

2800
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:37,990
那就是我想渡过余生的地方

2801
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:42,190
A warm place with no memory.

2802
01:43:39,690 --> 01:43:42,190
一个没有记忆的温暖地方

2803
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,290
Open up a little hotel

2804
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:47,290
开间小旅馆

2805
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,490
right on the beach.

2806
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:50,490
就在沙滩边上

2807
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:53,290
Buy some worthless old boat

2808
01:43:51,090 --> 01:43:53,290
买艘不值钱的旧船回来

2809
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:55,490
and fix it up new.

2810
01:43:53,890 --> 01:43:55,490
把它翻新

2811
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,490
Take my guests out

2812
01:43:58,190 --> 01:43:59,490
载着我的客人

2813
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:01,690
charter fishing.

2814
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:01,690
出海钓鱼

2815
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:07,290
Zihuatanejo.

2816
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:07,290
圣哈塔尼奥

2817
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:14,690
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

2818
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:14,690
在那种地方 我需要个能找到东西的人

2819
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,990
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

2820
01:44:21,190 --> 01:44:23,990
我觉得外面的社会可能不适合我

2821
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,790
I been in here most of my life.

2822
01:44:30,690 --> 01:44:32,790
我的大半生都在这里渡过

2823
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,990
I'm an institutional man now.

2824
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:35,990
我已经是这里的一部分了

2825
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,590
Just like Brooks was.

2826
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,590
就像布鲁克那样

2827
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,790
You underestimate yourself.

2828
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:41,790
你看轻了你自己

2829
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,990
I don't think so.

2830
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:43,990
我不这样看

2831
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:51,690
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but

2832
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:51,690
在此我能供应物品给你 但是

2833
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:54,990
outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

2834
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:54,990
在外面你只需要电话簿黄页分类

2835
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,490
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

2836
01:44:55,190 --> 01:44:57,490
我不知道如何开始

2837
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:01,190
Pacific Ocean?

2838
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:01,190
太平洋?

2839
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:05,390
Scare me to death, something that big.

2840
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:05,390
那么大的地方会吓死我的

2841
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:06,890
Not me.

2842
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:06,890
我不怕

2843
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:10,890
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.

2844
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:10,890
我没开枪杀我妻子 我也没开枪杀她的情人

2845
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:15,890
Whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.

2846
01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:15,890
不论我犯了什么错 我都已补偿了

2847
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:18,390
That hotel, that boat

2848
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:18,390
旅馆 船

2849
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:22,390
I don't think that's too much to ask.

2850
01:45:20,190 --> 01:45:22,390
我要的并不太多

2851
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,790
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

2852
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,790
我劝你不要再想了

2853
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,990
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

2854
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:31,990
那只是你的梦想罢了

2855
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,890
Mexico is way down there and you're in here

2856
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,890
墨西哥在遥远的天边 而你在这里

2857
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,690
and that's the way it is.

2858
01:45:35,090 --> 01:45:36,690
这才是现实

2859
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:39,790
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

2860
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:39,790
是的 是这样

2861
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:43,790
It's down there and I'm in here.

2862
01:45:41,390 --> 01:45:43,790
它在远方 而我在这里

2863
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:49,090
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

2864
01:45:46,290 --> 01:45:49,090
我想只有一个简单的选择

2865
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:53,490
Get busy living

2866
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:53,490
要么忙着活

2867
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,890
or get busy dying.

2868
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:56,890
要么忙着死

2869
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:11,690
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

2870
01:46:08,990 --> 01:46:11,690
如果你能出去的话 帮我做件事

2871
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:14,190
Sure, Andy. Anything.

2872
01:46:11,890 --> 01:46:14,190
当然可以 安迪 什么事都行

2873
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,890
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?

2874
01:46:16,090 --> 01:46:19,890
布克斯顿附近有个草场 你知道在哪里吗?

2875
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:24,490
A lot of hayfields up there. One in particular.

2876
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:24,490
那里有许多牧场 有一个很特别

2877
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:28,690
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

2878
01:46:24,690 --> 01:46:28,690
它有很长的石墙 北边的尽头有棵橡树

2879
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:31,690
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

2880
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:31,690
像佛洛斯特「美国著名诗人」的诗描绘的那样

2881
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,190
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

2882
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:35,190
那是我向我太太求婚的地方

2883
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,690
We went there for a picnic

2884
01:46:36,590 --> 01:46:38,690
我们到那里去野餐

2885
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:41,190
and made love under that oak

2886
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:41,190
还在橡树下做爱

2887
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:44,090
and I asked and she said yes.

2888
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:44,090
我向她求婚 她答应了

2889
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:49,890
Promise me, Red.

2890
01:46:48,090 --> 01:46:49,890
答应我 瑞德

2891
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:52,390
If you ever get out

2892
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:52,390
如果你出去的话

2893
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:54,090
find that spot.

2894
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:54,090
找到那里

2895
01:46:55,290 --> 01:47:00,090
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

2896
01:46:55,290 --> 01:47:00,090
在墙角下 有块与众不同的石头

2897
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:04,290
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

2898
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:04,290
一块黑色的火山玻璃石

2899
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:09,590
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

2900
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:09,590
下面埋着我想给你的东西

2901
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:11,590
What, Andy?

2902
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:11,590
是什么 安迪?

2903
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,790
What's buried under there?

2904
01:47:11,990 --> 01:47:13,790
埋在那里的是什么?

2905
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:17,190
You'll have to pry it up

2906
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:17,190
你自己挖出来

2907
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:18,690
to see.

2908
01:47:17,390 --> 01:47:18,690
就知道了

2909
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:26,590
No, I'm telling you. The guy is

2910
01:47:24,590 --> 01:47:26,590
不 我告诉你 他

2911
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,990
He's talking funny.

2912
01:47:27,190 --> 01:47:28,990
他只是在开玩笑

2913
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,790
I'm really worried about him.

2914
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:31,790
我真的很担心他

2915
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,590
Let's keep an eye on him.

2916
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:33,590
那就好好看着他吧

2917
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:37,090
That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.

2918
01:47:33,790 --> 01:47:37,090
白天还可以 但晚上怎么办?

2919
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:39,590
Oh, Lord.

2920
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:39,590
上帝

2921
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:41,790
What?

2922
01:47:40,990 --> 01:47:41,790
什么事?

2923
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,090
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

2924
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,090
安迪今天到我这里来过

2925
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:48,390
He asked me for a length of rope.

2926
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:48,390
他问我要了捆绳索

2927
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:49,390
Rope?

2928
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:49,390
绳索?

2929
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:51,290
Six feet long.

2930
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:51,290
六英尺长

2931
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:52,890
And you gave it to him.

2932
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:52,890
那你给他了?

2933
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,490
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

2934
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:55,490
当然为什么不呢?

2935
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:57,290
Jesus! Heywood.

2936
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:57,290
上帝!海伍德

2937
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:59,890
How was I supposed to know?

2938
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:59,890
我怎么知道?

2939
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:01,590
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

2940
01:48:00,090 --> 01:48:01,590
还记得布鲁克斯吗?

2941
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,590
Andy would never do that.

2942
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:05,590
不 安迪不会那样做的

2943
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,290
Never.

2944
01:48:06,190 --> 01:48:07,290
永远不会

2945
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:10,690
I don't know.

2946
01:48:09,290 --> 01:48:10,690
我不敢肯定

2947
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:15,490
Every man has his breaking point.

2948
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:15,490
人总有脆弱的一刻

2949
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:20,090
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

2950
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:20,090
快点要收工了

2951
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:22,190
Just about finished, sir.

2952
01:48:20,390 --> 01:48:22,190
还差一点点了

2953
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,990
Three deposits tonight.

2954
01:48:39,290 --> 01:48:40,990
今晚有三笔存款

2955
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:50,790
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

2956
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:50,790
把我的衣服拿到洗衣处去

2957
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:52,690
And shine my shoes.

2958
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:52,690
还要擦一下我的鞋子

2959
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:55,790
- I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.

2960
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:55,790
- 我要它们看起来像镜子一样亮 - 好的 先生

2961
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,790
It's good having you back,Andy.

2962
01:49:01,290 --> 01:49:02,790
你能回来真好 安迪

2963
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:05,590
Place wasn't the same without you.

2964
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:05,590
你不在的话一切都不一样了

2965
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,490
Lights out!

2966
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:53,490
熄灯

2967
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:28,890
I've had some long nights in stir.

2968
01:50:26,390 --> 01:50:28,890
那是个辗转难眠的长夜

2969
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:32,090
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts

2970
01:50:29,390 --> 01:50:32,090
孤独的黑暗中只有思想

2971
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:34,990
time can draw out like a blade.

2972
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:34,990
时间像把快刀

2973
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:43,290
That was the longest night of my life.

2974
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:43,290
那是我一生中最漫长的夜晚

2975
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:00,290
Give me a count!

2976
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:00,290
清点人数

2977
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:07,690
Tier 3 south, clear!

2978
01:51:04,790 --> 01:51:07,690
南边三楼 人齐了

2979
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:13,990
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

2980
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:13,990
二楼245囚室的人不见了

2981
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:15,190
Dufresne!

2982
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:15,190
德弗瑞恩!

2983
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:18,190
Come out. You're holding up the show!

2984
01:51:15,790 --> 01:51:18,190
快出来!不要耍花样

2985
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:24,790
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!

2986
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:24,790
别要我下来打爆你的头

2987
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:36,190
Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

2988
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:36,190
他妈的 你不要耽误我 我还有很多事要做

2989
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:39,690
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!

2990
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:39,690
你最好是病了或者死了

2991
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:41,190
You hear me?

2992
01:51:39,890 --> 01:51:41,190
你听到了吗?

2993
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,390
Oh, my Holy God.

2994
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,390
啊 我的上帝!

2995
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,990
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

2996
01:52:06,390 --> 01:52:08,990
查问这里的每一个犯人

2997
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,990
- Start with that friend of his. - Who?

2998
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,990
- 从他的好朋友开始 - 谁?

2999
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:16,090
Open 237.

3000
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:16,090
打开237号的门

3001
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:23,290
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.

3002
01:52:19,590 --> 01:52:23,290
你什么意思 "他不在这了"?别跟我说这种话

3003
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,490
Don't tell me that again.

3004
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,490
别再这样说

3005
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,690
But sir, he wasn't.

3006
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,690
但是长官 他真的不在那里

3007
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,390
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

3008
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:30,390
我看得见!你认为我瞎了吗?

3009
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:32,490
Is that what you're saying?

3010
01:52:31,090 --> 01:52:32,490
这就是你想说的吗?

3011
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:35,390
- Am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!

3012
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:35,390
- 我瞎了吗? - 没有!长官

3013
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:38,790
What about you. You blind?

3014
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:38,790
那你呢?你瞎了吗?

3015
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,790
Tell me what this is. Last night's count.

3016
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,790
告诉我这是什么? 昨晚的查房记录

3017
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:45,290
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.

3018
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:45,290
你看到德弗瑞恩的名字吗?我确定 就在那里

3019
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,890
"Dufresne."

3020
01:52:45,490 --> 01:52:46,890
"德弗瑞恩"

3021
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:49,990
He was in his cell

3022
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:49,990
他熄灯的时候

3023
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:51,190
at lights out.

3024
01:52:50,190 --> 01:52:51,190
还在囚室里的

3025
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,690
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

3026
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,690
因此今早他也应该在

3027
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:56,290
I want him found.

3028
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:56,290
我要找到他

3029
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:59,990
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

3030
01:52:56,590 --> 01:52:59,990
不是明天 不是早饭后 是现在

3031
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:01,490
Yes, sir.

3032
01:53:00,290 --> 01:53:01,490
是的 长官

3033
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,690
Let's go. Move your butts.

3034
01:53:02,490 --> 01:53:04,690
快走

3035
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,090
Stand.

3036
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:09,090
站好

3037
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:11,590
Well?

3038
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:11,590
那么?

3039
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:16,090
Well, what?

3040
01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:16,090
那么 什么?

3041
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,690
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.

3042
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:19,690
你们常在一起 亲密得像做贼一样

3043
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,290
He must have said something.

3044
01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:22,290
他肯定对你说过些什么

3045
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,590
No, sir, Warden.

3046
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:24,590
没有 先生 狱长

3047
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:25,890
Not a word.

3048
01:53:24,890 --> 01:53:25,890
什么都没说

3049
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:30,290
Lord, it's a miracle!

3050
01:53:27,790 --> 01:53:30,290
主啊 这是个奇迹

3051
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,490
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

3052
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,490
人就像屁一样在风中消失了

3053
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:35,290
Nothing left

3054
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:35,290
什么都没留下

3055
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:38,890
but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

3056
01:53:36,190 --> 01:53:38,890
只剩下窗台上的石头

3057
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:41,790
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.

3058
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:41,790
和那墙上的小妞 问问她吧

3059
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:43,790
Maybe she knows.

3060
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:43,790
也许她知道些什么

3061
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:46,790
What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?

3062
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:46,790
你想说什么?

3063
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:49,490
Guess not.

3064
01:53:48,190 --> 01:53:49,490
我想没有

3065
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:52,290
Why should she be any different?

3066
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:52,290
为什么她有点特别?

3067
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:54,990
This is a conspiracy.

3068
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:54,990
这是一个阴谋

3069
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:57,490
That's what this is.

3070
01:53:55,590 --> 01:53:57,490
肯定是的

3071
01:53:58,090 --> 01:54:01,790
One big, damn conspiracy!

3072
01:53:58,090 --> 01:54:01,790
一个该死的大阴谋

3073
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,090
And everyone's in on it!

3074
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,090
所有人都有参与

3075
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:05,890
Including her!

3076
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:05,890
包括她

3077
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:42,590
In 1966

3078
01:54:40,890 --> 01:54:42,590
在1966年

3079
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:45,190
Andy Dufresne escaped

3080
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:45,190
安迪·德弗瑞恩

3081
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:46,990
from Shawshank Prison.

3082
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:46,990
从肖申克监狱逃了出去

3083
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:51,790
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes

3084
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:51,790
他们只能找到泥塘中的囚衣

3085
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:53,990
a bar of soap

3086
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:53,990
一块肥皂

3087
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,690
and an old rock hammer

3088
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,690
和一个很旧的手槌

3089
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:58,390
damn near worn down to the nub.

3090
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:58,390
几乎快被削成一小块

3091
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:07,690
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

3092
01:55:02,890 --> 01:55:07,690
我曾认为用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道

3093
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:10,890
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

3094
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:10,890
安迪用不到二十年就办到了

3095
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:31,490
Oh, Andy loved geology.

3096
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:31,490
安迪很喜欢地质学

3097
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:35,490
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

3098
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:35,490
我能想像这归功于他一丝不苟的本性

3099
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:37,690
An ice age here

3100
01:55:35,890 --> 01:55:37,690
如果这里有一段冰河时期

3101
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:40,590
million years of mountain building there.

3102
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:40,590
百万年后 山脉就会在那里形成

3103
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:44,490
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

3104
01:55:41,690 --> 01:55:44,490
地质学是关于压力和时间的研究

3105
01:55:45,290 --> 01:55:47,290
That's all it takes, really.

3106
01:55:45,290 --> 01:55:47,290
需要的仅仅就是这些

3107
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,090
Pressure

3108
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:49,090
压力

3109
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:51,090
and time.

3110
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:51,090
和时间

3111
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:54,490
That and a big goddamn poster.

3112
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:54,490
还有一张大海报

3113
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:59,390
Like I said

3114
01:55:58,490 --> 01:55:59,390
就像我说的那样

3115
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:03,890
in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

3116
01:55:59,890 --> 01:56:03,890
监狱里的人都会找事情来消磨时间

3117
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:11,490
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard

3118
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:11,490
看起来安迪的爱好是把他的墙搬运到广场上

3119
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,990
a handful at a time.

3120
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,990
每次一把

3121
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,390
I guess after Tommy was killed

3122
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:17,390
我猜在汤姆被杀后

3123
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:20,590
Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

3124
01:56:17,590 --> 01:56:20,590
安迪觉得他在此呆得已够久了

3125
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:23,290
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

3126
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:23,290
尽快 我要回家了

3127
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:26,090
I'm just about finished, sir.

3128
01:56:24,090 --> 01:56:26,090
我马上就好了

3129
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:49,490
Three deposits tonight.

3130
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:49,490
今晚有三笔存款

3131
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:59,090
Andy did like he was told.

3132
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:59,090
安迪照他的吩咐

3133
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:02,790
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

3134
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:02,790
把鞋擦得闪闪发亮

3135
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:08,790
The guards simply didn't notice.

3136
01:57:06,490 --> 01:57:08,790
警卫完全没有注意到

3137
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:10,490
Neither did I.

3138
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:10,490
我也没有

3139
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,290
I mean, seriously

3140
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,290
说真的

3141
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:15,490
how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

3142
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:15,490
谁会留意别人穿的鞋子呢?

3143
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:22,190
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards

3144
01:59:18,990 --> 01:59:22,190
安迪朝向自由爬了五百码

3145
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:25,790
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

3146
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:25,790
我难以想像有多臭的下水道

3147
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:29,090
Or maybe I just don't want to.

3148
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:29,090
或许我只是不想去爬

3149
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:35,890
Five hundred yards.

3150
01:59:33,490 --> 01:59:35,890
五百码

3151
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:39,390
That's the length of five football fields.

3152
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:39,390
有五个足球场那么长

3153
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,590
Just shy of half a mile.

3154
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,590
有半英里左右

3155
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:42,490
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret

3156
02:00:37,890 --> 02:00:42,490
第二天早上 就在那海报被撕下来的时候

3157
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:45,590
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

3158
02:00:42,790 --> 02:00:45,590
一个从未出现过的人

3159
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:48,390
strolled into the Maine National Bank.

3160
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:48,390
走进了缅因州国家银行

3161
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:52,190
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

3162
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:52,190
在那一刻前 他从来是不存在的

3163
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:55,090
Except on paper. May I help you?

3164
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:55,090
除了在纸上 我可以帮忙吗?

3165
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:57,490
He had all the proper ID

3166
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:57,490
他有所有正确的身份证明文件

3167
02:00:57,690 --> 02:01:01,390
driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card

3168
02:00:57,690 --> 02:01:01,390
驾驶执照、出生证明、社会安全证

3169
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:04,290
And the signature was a spot-on match.

3170
02:01:01,790 --> 02:01:04,290
签名也是正确的

3171
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:07,590
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

3172
02:01:04,490 --> 02:01:07,590
不能再为你服务真的很遗憾

3173
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,590
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

3174
02:01:07,790 --> 02:01:09,590
希望你在国外生活愉快

3175
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,490
Thank you.

3176
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:11,490
谢谢

3177
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,290
I'm sure I will.

3178
02:01:12,090 --> 02:01:13,290
我想我会的

3179
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:17,490
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?

3180
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:17,490
先生 这是你的本票 还有别的吗?

3181
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,690
Please.

3182
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:18,690
请问

3183
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:21,790
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

3184
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:21,790
你能帮我把它寄出吗?

3185
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:23,490
I'd be happy to.

3186
02:01:22,290 --> 02:01:23,490
我很乐意

3187
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:26,690
Good day, sir.

3188
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:26,690
再见 先生

3189
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:31,990
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

3190
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:31,990
史蒂文先生那天早上去了将近十二家银行

3191
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:34,090
All told, he blew town

3192
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:34,090
加起来

3193
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:39,090
with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

3194
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:39,090
他总共提取了三十七万诺顿狱长的钱

3195
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:42,590
Severance pay for 19 years.

3196
02:01:39,790 --> 02:01:42,590
作为十九年的赔偿

3197
02:01:49,890 --> 02:01:51,990
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

3198
02:01:49,890 --> 02:01:51,990
早上好 波特兰时报

3199
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:55,190
"肖申克监狱 贪污谋杀"

3200
02:02:03,090 --> 02:02:05,490
"主的审判迅速降临"

3201
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:24,890
"亲爱的典狱长 你说的对"

3202
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:26,790
"得救之道 就在其中"

3203
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:47,290
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

3204
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:47,290
拜伦·哈德利?你有权保持沉默

3205
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:52,490
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

3206
02:02:47,290 --> 02:02:52,490
否则你所说的一切都将对你不利

3207
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:56,590
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl

3208
02:02:52,990 --> 02:02:56,590
我虽没有亲眼看到 但我听说他被带走时

3209
02:02:56,590 --> 02:02:59,090
when they took him away.

3210
02:02:56,590 --> 02:02:59,090
哭得像个娘们

3211
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:08,390
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

3212
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:08,390
诺顿没有静静离开的意思

3213
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:25,090
Samuel Norton.

3214
02:03:24,290 --> 02:03:25,090
森姆·诺顿?

3215
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:28,290
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

3216
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:28,290
我们有拘捕令 开门!

3217
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,190
Open the door.

3218
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,190
开门吧

3219
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:35,990
I'm not sure which key.

3220
02:03:34,690 --> 02:03:35,990
我不知是哪把钥匙

3221
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:48,090
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

3222
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:48,090
别紧张 诺顿

3223
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:02,990
I like to think the last thing that went through his head

3224
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:02,990
我想知道当子弹穿过他的头的时候

3225
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:04,790
other than that bullet

3226
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:04,790
他在想些什么

3227
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:09,490
was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

3228
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:09,490
是在想该死的安迪·德弗瑞恩到底是如何击败他?

3229
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:15,490
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company

3230
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:15,490
诺顿狱长一伙倒台之后

3231
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:17,790
I got a postcard in the mail.

3232
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:17,790
我收到了张明信片

3233
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:22,090
It was blank, but the postmark said

3234
02:04:19,290 --> 02:04:22,090
它是空白的 但是邮戳是

3235
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:24,390
Fort Hancock, Texas.

3236
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:24,390
汉格堡 德萨斯州的

3237
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,290
Fort Hancock

3238
02:04:24,990 --> 02:04:26,290
汉格堡

3239
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,290
right on the border.

3240
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,290
就在边境那里

3241
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:30,690
That's where Andy crossed.

3242
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:30,690
安迪就是从那里出国的

3243
02:04:31,290 --> 02:04:35,290
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down

3244
02:04:31,290 --> 02:04:35,290
当我想到他开车向南走的时候

3245
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,990
it always makes me laugh.

3246
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:37,990
我总会笑起来

3247
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,390
Andy Dufresne

3248
02:04:39,890 --> 02:04:41,390
安迪·德弗瑞恩

3249
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:43,790
who crawled through a river of shit

3250
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:43,790
爬过了那臭屎沟

3251
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:46,390
and came out clean on the other side.

3252
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:46,390
然后干干净净的到另一边去了

3253
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:48,590
Andy Dufresne

3254
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:48,590
安迪·德弗瑞恩

3255
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,990
headed for the Pacific.

3256
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:50,990
向太平洋进发

3257
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:56,190
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

3258
02:04:53,990 --> 02:04:56,190
哈德利抓住他的头 对吗?

3259
02:04:56,390 --> 02:05:00,190
He says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

3260
02:04:56,390 --> 02:05:00,190
他说 "我相信他将会发生意外"

3261
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:03,190
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

3262
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:03,190
我们跟他熟的老是谈起安迪

3263
02:05:03,890 --> 02:05:05,590
I swear, the stuff he pulled

3264
02:05:03,890 --> 02:05:05,590
我发誓 他总是带来话题

3265
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:08,790
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

3266
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:08,790
"我的朋友可以要两瓶啤酒"

3267
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:10,790
And he got it!

3268
02:05:09,090 --> 02:05:10,790
他成功了

3269
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:14,390
Sometimes it makes me sad, though

3270
02:05:11,990 --> 02:05:14,390
有时那令我伤心 虽然

3271
02:05:14,690 --> 02:05:16,090
Andy being gone.

3272
02:05:14,690 --> 02:05:16,090
安迪已经离开了

3273
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:21,090
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

3274
02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:21,090
我不得不提醒自己有些鸟是不能关在笼子里的

3275
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:23,490
Their feathers are just too bright.

3276
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:23,490
他们的每一片羽毛都沾着自由的光辉.

3277
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:26,890
And when they fly away

3278
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:26,890
当它们飞走的时候

3279
02:05:27,390 --> 02:05:31,790
the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

3280
02:05:27,390 --> 02:05:31,790
你会觉得把它们关起来是种罪恶

3281
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:34,090
But still

3282
02:05:32,790 --> 02:05:34,090
但是

3283
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:38,890
the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

3284
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:38,890
它们的离开让你生活的地方空荡荡的

3285
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:45,490
I guess I just miss my friend.

3286
02:05:43,090 --> 02:05:45,490
可能我只是想念我的朋友了

3287
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:11,090
Please sit down.

3288
02:06:10,190 --> 02:06:11,090
请坐

3289
02:06:16,990 --> 02:06:18,490
Ellis Boyd Redding

3290
02:06:16,990 --> 02:06:18,490
瑞德

3291
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:22,290
your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

3292
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:22,290
你因终身监禁已被关了40年了

3293
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:25,290
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

3294
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:25,290
你觉得你已改过了吗?

3295
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:28,690
Rehabilitated?

3296
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:28,690
改过?

3297
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:32,590
Well, now, let me see.

3298
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:32,590
让我想想

3299
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:35,990
I don't have any idea what that means.

3300
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:35,990
我不明白那是什么意思

3301
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:40,290
It means you're ready to rejoin society

3302
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:40,290
你有心理准备重新投入社会吗?

3303
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:43,190
I know what you think it means, sonny.

3304
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:43,190
我知道你们是怎么想的 老弟

3305
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:47,390
To me it's just a made-up word.

3306
02:06:45,390 --> 02:06:47,390
对我来说那只是个用来掩饰的词

3307
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:51,090
A politician's word so that

3308
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:51,090
政客用的词语

3309
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:54,990
young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie

3310
02:06:51,490 --> 02:06:54,990
让你们年青人能穿西装打领带

3311
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:57,090
and have a job.

3312
02:06:55,490 --> 02:06:57,090
有一份好工作

3313
02:06:59,090 --> 02:07:01,190
What do you really want to know?

3314
02:06:59,090 --> 02:07:01,190
你倒底想知道些什么?

3315
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:03,790
Am I sorry for what I did?

3316
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:03,790
我对自己所犯的罪感到后悔吗?

3317
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,490
Well, are you?

3318
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:05,490
你有后悔吗?

3319
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:10,290
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

3320
02:07:06,890 --> 02:07:10,290
没有一天我不感到后悔的

3321
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:15,090
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

3322
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:15,090
不是因为我在监狱里 或者你认为我该这样

3323
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:21,090
I look back on the way I was then

3324
02:07:17,990 --> 02:07:21,090
我回首过往

3325
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:24,390
a young

3326
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:24,390
一个年青的

3327
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:28,990
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

3328
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:28,990
愚蠢的孩子犯了大罪

3329
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:33,790
I want to talk to him.

3330
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:33,790
我想和他谈谈

3331
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:38,190
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

3332
02:07:35,090 --> 02:07:38,190
我想和他讲讲道理

3333
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:40,790
Tell him the way things are.

3334
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:40,790
告诉他做人道理

3335
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:44,390
But I can't.

3336
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:44,390
但已经不能了

3337
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:48,590
That kid's long gone

3338
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:48,590
那孩子已无影无踪

3339
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:52,490
and this old man is all that's left.

3340
02:07:49,190 --> 02:07:52,490
只剩下这个老人

3341
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:55,390
I got to live with that.

3342
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:55,390
我得这样生活下去

3343
02:07:56,190 --> 02:07:58,290
Rehabilitated?

3344
02:07:56,190 --> 02:07:58,290
改过?

3345
02:07:58,290 --> 02:08:00,690
It's just a bullshit word.

3346
02:07:58,290 --> 02:08:00,690
只是个狗屁的字眼

3347
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,890
So you go on and stamp your forms

3348
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,890
你继续盖上你的印章吧

3349
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,390
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

3350
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,390
老弟 别再浪费我的时间了

3351
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:09,690
Because to tell you the truth

3352
02:08:07,090 --> 02:08:09,690
说句实话

3353
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:12,190
I don't give a shit.

3354
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:12,190
我根本不在乎

3355
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:26,090
"通过"

3356
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:23,790
"布鲁斯到此"

3357
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:40,190
Here you go, miss.

3358
02:09:38,190 --> 02:09:40,190
你的 小姐

3359
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:44,090
Restroom break?

3360
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:44,090
我可以去洗手间吗?

3361
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:54,490
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

3362
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:54,490
你不用每次都问我 去吧

3363
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:10,590
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

3364
02:10:06,890 --> 02:10:10,590
四十年来我小便都要经过批准

3365
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:14,390
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

3366
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:14,390
不批准的话一滴都尿不出来

3367
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:20,090
There's a harsh truth to face.

3368
02:10:17,390 --> 02:10:20,090
现实是很难面对的

3369
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:24,690
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

3370
02:10:21,190 --> 02:10:24,690
我不习惯外面的生活

3371
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:35,990
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole

3372
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:35,990
我总在想怎样才能违反假释条例

3373
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:39,490
so maybe they'd send me back.

3374
02:10:36,490 --> 02:10:39,490
那样他们会把我再送进去

3375
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:47,190
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

3376
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:47,190
生活在恐惧中是很可怕的

3377
02:10:47,490 --> 02:10:49,390
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

3378
02:10:47,490 --> 02:10:49,390
布鲁克是知道的

3379
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:51,890
Knew it all too well.

3380
02:10:49,390 --> 02:10:51,890
他知道得太清楚了

3381
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:56,690
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

3382
02:10:52,890 --> 02:10:56,690
我只想回到能适合我的地方

3383
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:59,990
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

3384
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:59,990
令我不用再担心受怕的地方

3385
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:04,390
Only one thing stops me.

3386
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:04,390
只有一件事阻止了我这么做

3387
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:08,190
A promise I made to Andy.

3388
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:08,190
我对安迪作出的承诺

3389
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:29,890
There it is.

3390
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:29,890
就在那里

3391
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:42,190
Much obliged, sir.

3392
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:42,190
非常感谢 先生

3393
02:11:51,490 --> 02:11:52,790
"布克斯顿"

3394
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:22,390
Dear Red:

3395
02:15:20,890 --> 02:15:22,390
亲爱的瑞德

3396
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:25,090
If you're reading this, you've gotten out

3397
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:25,090
若你能看到这封信 那你已经出来了

3398
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:29,390
and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.

3399
02:15:25,090 --> 02:15:29,390
如果你已来了这么远 也许可以再前进一点

3400
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:32,490
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

3401
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:32,490
你还记得那个地方的名字 是吗?

3402
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:36,290
Zihuatanejo.

3403
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:36,290
圣哈塔尼奥

3404
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:41,290
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

3405
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:41,290
我需要一个人和我一起工作

3406
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:45,390
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

3407
02:15:41,390 --> 02:15:45,390
我期待你的到来 计划已经摆好了

3408
02:15:45,790 --> 02:15:47,490
Remember, Red

3409
02:15:45,790 --> 02:15:47,490
记住 瑞德

3410
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,790
hope is a good thing

3411
02:15:47,490 --> 02:15:49,790
希望是件好东西

3412
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:51,990
maybe the best of things.

3413
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:51,990
也许是世上最好的东西

3414
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:54,690
And no good thing ever dies.

3415
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:54,690
好东西从来不会流逝

3416
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:57,790
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

3417
02:15:54,690 --> 02:15:57,790
我希望这封信能见到你

3418
02:15:57,790 --> 02:15:59,990
and finds you well.

3419
02:15:57,790 --> 02:15:59,990
见到你很好

3420
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,490
Your friend

3421
02:15:59,990 --> 02:16:01,490
你的朋友

3422
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:03,190
Andy.

3423
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:03,190
安迪

3424
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:38,390
"Get busy living

3425
02:16:36,490 --> 02:16:38,390
"要么忙着活

3426
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:40,890
or get busy dying. "

3427
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:40,890
要么忙着死"

3428
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:45,690
That's goddamn right.

3429
02:16:42,990 --> 02:16:45,690
这话一点都没错

3430
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:50,190
"瑞德也来过"

3431
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:52,790
For the second time in my life

3432
02:16:50,390 --> 02:16:52,790
我一生中第二次

3433
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:55,890
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

3434
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:55,890
犯了罪

3435
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:58,890
Parole violation.

3436
02:16:56,390 --> 02:16:58,890
违反了假释条例

3437
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:03,290
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

3438
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:03,290
当然 我怀疑他们会因此设下路障

3439
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:05,590
Not for an old crook like me.

3440
02:17:03,390 --> 02:17:05,590
尤其是像我这样的老人家

3441
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:08,190
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

3442
02:17:05,590 --> 02:17:08,190
德萨斯州 汉格堡

3443
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:16,490
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

3444
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:16,490
我是如此的激动 以致不能静静地坐下来思考

3445
02:17:16,490 --> 02:17:19,990
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

3446
02:17:16,490 --> 02:17:19,990
我想只有那些重获自由

3447
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:22,690
A free man at the start of a long journey

3448
02:17:19,990 --> 02:17:22,690
即将踏上新征程的人们

3449
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:25,890
whose conclusion is uncertain.

3450
02:17:22,690 --> 02:17:25,890
才能感受到这种即将揭开未来神秘面纱的激动心情

3451
02:17:28,290 --> 02:17:31,590
I hope I can make it across the border.

3452
02:17:28,290 --> 02:17:31,590
我希望我能成功越过边界

3453
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:36,090
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

3454
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:36,090
我希望跨越千山万水握住朋友的手

3455
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:41,990
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

3456
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:41,990
我希望太平洋的海水如我梦中那样的蓝

3457
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,090
I hope.

3458
02:17:43,890 --> 02:17:45,090
我希望

3459
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:23,890
谨此纪念亚伦格林

3460
02:18:24,410 --> 02:18:28,910
懦怯囚禁人的灵魂 希望可以感受自由
Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.
