## Reflections (5)

11. *What does the hope mean in the movie? And how do you think of it?*

    Red once tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing, and it can drive a man insane. However, Andy insists his hope of escape for several years. It's hope that supports he hangs the cell wall day after day, and escapes through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe. And it's hope that give Red the determination of parole and reunion with Andy. In a word, hope is a thread of the movie.

    From this movie, I find that hope is that which drive people. Hope is our inspiration. A man without hope is a body and soul with no aim. Hope drives people to do impossible possible though the impossible thing might be small or of no importance to society still it's a great achievement.

12. *"some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright." How do you understand this sentence?*

    When Brooks opened the cage door and set the birds free, he said these words. There are two levels of meanings of the sentence. One is the literal meaning, while another indicates that Andy's brilliant talent is as the bird's bright feathers, and he shouldn't stay here for the whole life.

13. *Do you think the prison is a metaphor of life? Why?*

    Yes. As a metaphor for life, the prison includes many elements related to our real life, such as setbacks, eyesore, hope, victims. The human experience often includes a feeling of being victimized.  We have all seen people like the Warden and many of the inmates in our own life. In fact, we are left to wonder about Andy's innocence or guilt for much of the film. That also adds to the power of his innocence, and the power and determination of his final escape.

14. *How do you understand the word "institutional"? What does Red mean by this and how does it effect his life?*

    For Red, being an "institutional" man is being able to live a life that is predicated upon routine and predictability. He does the same action and then repeating it day after day in the prison. Finally he used to the institution that the prisoner brings him and lose other abilities that can make a living in the society.


15. *What do you learn from the movie?*

    The Shawshank Redemption is powerful, as the core spirit of the of the story lies in the fact that it’s only during the darkest times of one’s life that one realizes the importance of thinking out of the box.

    1. Perseverance can be great tool to put an end to all sorts of miseries. But it’s not for the faint hearted. (Andy needed to dig the tunnel for 20 long years, it required foresight and perseverance).
    2. When encountered with troubles that are worse than the worst nightmare you have ever had, it’s better to accept the reality sooner than trying to fight against the present situation helplessly. (The incident of the fat guy who is scared to shit on the very first night in the prison and finally succumbs to his fear and to the Capt. Byron Hadley’s stick).
