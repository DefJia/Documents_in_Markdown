##Introducing language 

####What is linguistics 
- Linguistics is the science of language, or it is the scientific study of language
####Significance 
- Linguistics can help us learn more about language and to have a deep understanding of how languages works
####What is language 
- Symbol
- Vocal
- Arbitrary
- Human communication 
- Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols used for human communication 
- What makes human language different from animal language?
  - No matter how eloquently a dog may bark,he cannot tell you that his parents were poor but honest 
####Design features of language 
- Arbitrariness
  - There is no logical connection or innate relationship between forms of linguistic signs and their meaning.
      - The relationship between speech sounds and the meanings they represent is, for the most part, arbitrary 
      - What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.
- Duality
  - Language has two levels of structures: sound and meaning 
  - The sounds can combine with one another to form units that have meanings
- Creativity/productivity 
  - Knowing s language means being able to produce new sentences never spoken before and to understand sentences never heard before.
  - This ability is a part of the creative aspect of language use
  - The creativity of language comes from duality and recursiveneess 
- Displacement 
  - Language can refer to contexts removed from the immediate situations of the speaker 
  - Displace meant means that human languages enable their languages enable their users to symbolize objects, events and concepts which are not present ( in time and space ) at the moment of communication 
####Functions of language
- Jakobson
  - Adresser - emotive
  - Addresses - conative
  - Context - referential 
  - Message - poetic
  - Code - metalingual
  - Contact - phatic 
- Halliday
  - Ideational function 
      - Language is used to organize understand, and express our experience of the world and f our own consciousness
      - We can say that ideational function can be used to construct a model of experience and logical relations
      - Subfunctions 
          - Experimental function
              - The experiential functions is largely concerned with the content and ideas
          - Logical function
              - The logical function is largely concerned with the relationship between ideas
  - Textual function
      - Language is used to relate what is said ( written ) to the real world and to other linguistic events
      - This involves the use of language to organize the text itself or to create relevance to context
  - Interpersonal function
      - Language enables us to participate in communicative acts with other people, to express and understand feelings, attitudes and judgements
- The author of the textbook 
  - Informative function
  - Interpersonal function
  - Performative function
  - Emotive function
  - Phatic function
  - Recreational function
  - Metalingual function
##Introducing linguistics 
####Definition of linguistics
- Linguistics can be defined as the scientific study of language
- Criteria for evaluation of language study
  - Exhaustiveness
      - The linguists should gather all the materials revelant to his investigation and give them an adequate explanation 
      - (If he leaves many facts undisclosed or unexplained, his study cannot be called exhaustive)
  - Consistency
      - There should be no contradiction between different parts of the total statement 
  - Economy
      - Other things being equal, a short statement or analysis is preferred to a longer or more complex one
  - Objective
      - A linguist should be as objective as possible in his description and analysis of data and cannot allow prejudice to influence his conclusion 
####Main branches of linguistics
- Phonetcis
- Phonology
- Morphology
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Pragmatics
####Macrolinguistics
- Psycholingguistics
- Sociolinguistics 
- Anthropological linguistics
- Computational linguistics
####Important distinctions in linguistics
- Descriptive/Prescriptive
  - A linguistic study is descriptive if it describes and analyses the fact observed 
  - It is prescriptive if it tries the lay down rules for the "correct" use of language 
  - In other words, if a linguist talks about " what people actually say", he is descriptive 
  - If he tells people " what should be in language " or " what people should say " , he is prescriptive 
- Synchronic/Diachronic
  - The descriptive of a language at some point in time is a synchronic study 
  - The descriptive of a language as it changes through the time is a diachronic study
  - Everything that relates to the static side of our science is synchronic ; everything that has to do with evolution is diachronic 
  - The distinction between synchronic and diachronic studies is only theoretically clear
  - In reality, it is not easy to draw a sharp line between these two aspects of language studies 
  - The reasons are as follows:
      - First, languages are in a constant state of changing
      - Secondly, the language of any speech community is never uniform
      - Thirdly, when a language changes, one set of features are not suddenly replaced by another set of features 
- Langue/Parole
  - Thus distinction is first made by the Swiss linguist, F. de Saussure early in this century
  - Langue: refers to the abstract linguistic system shared by all the members of a speech community 
  - Parole: Parole refers to the actualized language, or realization of langue
  - The distinction between langue and Parole
      - Language is abstract Parole is specific to the situation in which it occurs
      - Secondly,Langue is not actually spoken by anyone; a Parole is always a naturally occurring event
      - Thirdly, Langue is relatively stable and systematic; Parolr is subject to personal and situational constraints 
- Competence/Performance
  - Competence is the ideal language user's knowledge of the rules of his language
  - Performance is the actual relaxation of this knowledge in utterances 
##Phonetics
####Three branches of phonetics
- Articulately phonetics
  - Articulatory phonetics studies the production of speech sounds 
- Acoustic phonetics
  - Acoustic phonetics studies the physical properties of speech sounds
- Auditory phonetics
  - Auditory or perceptual phonetics studies the perception of speech sounds or how speech sounds are received or perceived by listeners 
####Speech organs
- Three cavities 
  - Oral cavity 
  - Nasal cavity
  - Pharyngeal cavity
####International phenolic alphabet
####Classification of consonants
- Manner of articulation 
  - Stop/plosive
  - Nasal 
  - Fricative 
  - Affricate
  - Approximant
  - Lateral 
- Places of articulation 
  - Bilabial
  - Labio-dental
  - Dental 
  - Alveolar 
  - Post-alveolar 
  - Palatal
  - Velar 
  - Glottal
####Classification of vowels 
- Criteria
  - The height of tongue raising 
  - The part of tongue that is raised :front ,central or back
  - The length of tenseness of the vowel
  - Lips rounding (rounded vs. unfounded )
##Phonology
####Definition of phonology
- Phenology is the study of the sound patterns and sound systems of languages
- Its primary aim is to discover the principle that govern how sounds are organized in languages,and to explain the variations that might occur 
####Phonetics and phonology
- The distinction between phonetics and phonology 
  - Phonetics studies how speech sounds are made, transmitted and received  VS. phonology studies the sound patterns and sound system of languages 
  - Phonetics is the study of all possible speech sounds VS. phonology studies hoe speaker of a language systematically use a selection of these sounds in order to express meaning 
####Basic unit of phonology :phoneme 
- A sound which is capable of distinguishing one word from another in a given language is a phoneme 
- Free variants 
  - If two sounds occurring in the same environment do not contrast, that is, the substitution of one for the other does not produce a different Orr form,but merely a different pronunciation of the same word, then the two sounds are in free variation 
- Allophone : the non-distinctive sounds of the same phoneme are called allophones  
  - Conditions for allophones 
      - The allophones for a phoneme must be phonetically similar
      - Complementary distribution 
          - When two sounds never occur in the same environment, they are said to be in complementary distribution 
####Segments in contrast 
- All speakers know which segments of their language contrast and which do not. Segments are said to contrast in a particular language when their presence alone may result in a change of meaning 
- Some knowledge of segmental contrasts is fundamental to knowing any language, the first step in an analysis of the phonology of a language is to establish which sounds in that language are in contrast with each other 
- In order to establish contrasts, it is necessary to examine the distribution of sounds in words and to compare word meanings
- The most straightforward way to accomplish this is by way of minimal pair test
- Minimal pairs 
  - A minimal pair consists of two forms with distinct meanings that differ by only one segment in the same position
####Distinctive features 
- A particular characteristic high distinguishes one distinctive sound unit of a language from another or one group of sounds from another group
####Syllable
- Stress
  - Stress refers to the degree of force used in producing a syllable 
  - Stress is a relative notion 
  - Word stress: words with two syllables
  - Sentence stress: in principle, a stress may fall in any word or syllable 
- Maximal onset principle 
  - When there is a choice as to where to place a consonant, it is put into the onset rather than the coda
- The syllabic structure 
  - English syllabic structure : ( ccc) v (cccc)
  - Chinese syllabic structure :(c) v (c) 
  - Open syllable 
  - Closed syllable 
####Phonological processes 
- Three aspects of a phonological process 
  - A set of sounds that will undergo the process 
  - A set of sounds produced by the process
  - A set of situations in which the process applies 
- Typical phonological processes 
  - Nasalization 
  - Dental inaction 
  - Velarization 
- Assimilation 
  - A process by which one sound takes on someone all the characteristics of a neighboring sound 
  - Assimilation is often used interchangeably with coarticukation 
  - **Progressive assimilation**
      - If a preceding sounds influences a following sound, so that the following sound takes on some or all the characteristics of the preceding sound, this phenomenon is termed progressive assimilation 
  - **Regressive assimilation**
      - If a following sound influences a preceding sound, so that the preceding sound takes on some ore all the characteristics f the following sounds, this phenomenon is called regressive assimilation 
- Devoicing 
  - A process by shiv voiced sounds become voiceless 
- The rule ordering 
  - Elsewhere condition : the more specific rule applies first 
##Morphology(I)
####What is morphology 
- Morphology studies the internal structure of words and the rules by which words are formed 
####What is morpheme, allomorph 
- Morpheme 
  - The minimal (smallest )meaningful unit is known as morpheme 
  - **The decomposition of words into morphemes illustrates one of the fundamental properties of human language --- (discreteness )</span>
- Allomorph 
  - The classification of morphs as allomorphs is based on
      - Similarity of meaning 
      - Complementary distribution 
  - Morph(语素形式）
      - The concrete form of a morpheme is called morph
      - Morphs are the actual forms used to realize morlnemes
  - Allomorph （语素变体）
      - Concretely realized variants of the same morpheme are allomorphs
####How can morphemes be classified 
- Root , stem and affix
  - Root is the base form of a word that cannot be further analyzed without the total loss of identity (that is to say , the root is the part of the word left when all the affixes are removed )
  - Stem is any morpheme or combination of morphemes to which an inflectional affix can be added (that is to say , stem is the part of the word left when inflectional affixes are removed )
  - Affix : the collective term for the types of morphemes that can be used only when added to another morpheme 
  - **All affix is bound ---free morpheme 不存在 affix</span>
  - Affixes can be divided into inflectional affix and derivational affix 
  - Affixes can also be divided into prefix, infix and suffix
  - Circumfix
- Free morphemes 
  - Those morphemes which can occur independent of other morphemes, or a morpheme that can be a word by itself 
  - **一个单词里必有一个 freemorpheme</span>
- Bound morphemes
  - Those which must appear with at least another morpheme 
  - Derivational morphemes 
      - A derivational morpheme is one that is used to derive a new word
      - E.g rich - enrich   Operate - operation 
  - Inflectional morhemes
      - Inflectional morphemes indicate the syntactic relationships between words and thus function as grammatical markets 
      - Process related to inflection 
          - Internal change 
          - Suppletion(不规则字形变化）
          - Reduplication 
          - Tone placement 
          - **True or False**
              - **Both derivational morphemes and inflectional morphemes are bound morphemes (T)**
      - Inflectional morphemes in English 
          - Inflections related to English nouns 
          - Inflections related to English verbs
          - Inflections related to English adjectives 
####What is morphonemics 
- Morphophonemics(形态语音学）
  - The analysis and classification of the phonological factors affecting three apperanve of morphemes
  - It studies the interrelationships between phonology and morphology
- Morphophonology（形态音系学）
- Phonological conditioning 
  - The form or shape of morphemes may be conditioned by phonological factors
- Dissimulation (异化）
  - Dissimulation referres to the influence exercised by one sound segment upon the articulation of another , so that the sounds become less alike , or different 
##Morphology (II)
####Definition of word 
- A grammatical unit between morpheme and word group 
  - Morpheme&lt;word &lt;word group&lt;phrase &lt;clause &lt;sentence 
- A physically definable unit 
  - Word may be seen as a cluster of sound segments or letters between two pauses or blanks
  - Problems in this difinition 
      - It is wonderful 
      - It's wonderful 
- Indentification of words
  - Stability 
  - Relative uninterruptibility 
  - A minimum free form
- The common factor underlying a set of forms
  - To avoid the ambiguity of "word" , lexeme is postulated, which is a word in an abstract sense
      - Eat, ears, ate ,eaten , eating these five word forms have one lexeme "eat"
####Classification of words
- Function words and content words
  - Function words
      - Function words : words that express grammatical meanings 
      - Also termed grammatical words
      - Conjunctions , prepositions , articles and pronouns determiners 
  - Content words
      - Words having lexical meanings
      - Also called lexical words
      - Nouns, verbs , adjectives, and adverbs
- Closed class words and open class words
  - Closed class words 
      - Closed class words refer to those words whose membership is fixed and limited 
      - Pronouns,prepositions , conjunctions , articles 
      - Function words are closed class words 
  - Open class words
      - Open class words refer to those words whose membership is in principle infinite or unlimited 
      - Nouns, verbs, adjectives , and many adverbs
      - Content words are open class words
####Formation of words
- Compounding 
- Affixation / derivation 
- Invention 
- Shortening 
  - Blending 混成法
  - Abbreviation 缩写法/clipping
  - Acronym / initiation 首字母缩略词
  - Back-formation 逆构法
##Syntax
####Definition of syntax 
- The study of the rules governing how words are combined to be form sentences in a language , or simply, the study of the formation of sentences 
####Syntactic relations
- Positional relation(word order)
  - Definition : it refers to the sequential arrangement of words in a language 
  - C-selection ( categorical selection )
  - S-selection ( semantic selection )
  - Explain 
  - Syntagmatic relation 
  - Horizontal relations
  - Chain relations 
- Relation of substitutability 
  - Associative relations ---Saussure 
  - Paradigmatic relation ---by Hjrmslev
  - Vertical relation
  - Choice relation 
- Relation of co-occurrence (共现关系）
####Immediate constituent (IC) analysis 
- IC analysis is the Ana,uses of a sentence in terms of its immediate constituents---world groups (or phrases), which ate in turn analyzed into the immediate condtituent soft their own , and the process goes on until the ultimate constituents ate reached 
- Tests for constituenthood
- Tree diagram/ bracketing 
####Endometric and exocentric constructions 

> Eg: The boy smiled.
>
> $[IP, [spec(the boy), I', [I(-ed), VP(smile)]]]$
>
>
