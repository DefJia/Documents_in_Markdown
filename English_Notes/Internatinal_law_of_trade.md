### Chapter 1 introduction to international and comparative law

#### 1. Customer Law: FOB / CIF

- FOB -> free on board
- CIF -> Cost Insurance and Freight

#### 2. Between countries: comity

Held that a court could request compliance by a foreign sovereign as a matter of comity, but could not order compliance

Comity requires that we respect other countries sovereignty and law so that they will respect ours.

- U.S. Courts Apply Comity and Refuse to Take Jurisdiction When:
  - The defendant is a sovereign state
  - Defendant has insufficient contacts with the U.S. 
  - Another judicial forum is more convenient 
  - Congress did not intend U.S. statute to apply extraterritorially (治外法权地)
  - Case concerns act of sovereign state on its own territory 

#### 3. Some country separates another country, how to divide their right?

With a change in sovereignty over territory, several legal consequences arise and we apply the following rules.

· Successor states are bound by **dispositive treaties**- treaties concerned with rights over territory (boundaries & servitudes)

**·** **Merge Rule**- treaties in effect in a former state remain in effect in its territory when in a former state remain in effect in its territory when it becomes part of a new state

  · Ex. Treaties of both Egypt and Syria remained in effect when they merged into the United Arab Republic 

**· Moving Boundaries Rule**- treaties of state absorbing new territory become effective within absorbed territory

  · Ex. France’s treaties displaced German treaties in annexed territory of Alsace-Lorraine at end of WWI 

**· Clean State Doctrine **– new state created from colony not bound by treaties of its former colonial power

 Succession of State **– when two states agree to join and form single state or when a state dissolve into two or more states, the new states are bound by the predecessor’s treaties.

> Eg: When the Soviet Union split in 1991, the 12 republics were bound by the existing treaties of the Soviet Union
